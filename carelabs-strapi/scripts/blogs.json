Faulty electrical systems or appliances can cause risks of electric shock and burns, fire, and explosion.\n\nThere is a legal responsibility on both employers and their employees to prevent danger by ensuring that electrical systems and appliances within the workplace are safe, suitable for use and maintained suitably appropriately. Part of this involves the inspection and testing of the electrical systems by a competent person, as well as keeping suitable records up to date.\n\nInspection and testing check condition of electrical installations and equipment on your premises. Assessing the risk is crucial to maintaining safe working conditions, and this will partly be covered by a company’s health and safety assessment. But some commercial electrical testing should carry out by a competent person who can give a legally recognised electrical test report. This will help show due diligence and compliance with legal requirements.\n\nOur team of experienced and fully qualified electricians offers a comprehensive testing and inspection service to give you peace of mind that every electrical element in your business is working safely and efficiently. During an electrical test of commercial property, the power may need to turn off.  We are flexible and can carry out the testing when it is most convenient for your business.\n\nOur engineers will check the electrical installation against the requirements of BS 7671 - Requirements for Electrical Installations ( IEE Wiring Regulations ) - as amended, which is the national safety standard for electrical installations.\n\n<b>The Importance of Commercial Electrical Testing and Inspections</b>\n\nAs an owner, you put so much of your energy and resources into your company's products, services, infrastructure and property. With all this personal and financial investment, the last thing you want is to lose any of your commercial assets due to an unexpected electrical fire. That's why having your business property appropriately tested and inspected for electrical issues is one of the most important steps you can take toward protecting your investments.\n\nBeyond simply making sure that all of your outlets and lighting fixtures are functional and efficient, an expert electrical inspection will include efforts to make sure electric appliances and systems have been properly installed and are in good working order. The wiring of the building is generally inspected for any potential weather damage or exposure to pests (like rodents, who might chew on the wires). Likewise, thorough testing of electrical equipment makes sure that all necessary business equipment functions properly and does not short-circuit or create any unnecessary strain on the system.\n\nElectrical testing and inspection aren't necessarily \"one-and-done\" process. To make sure the on-going safety and functioning of the electrical systems in place on your commercial property, it's important to have inspection and testing performed on a fairly regular basis.\n\nAlthough it can tempt to save yourself money and time by skipping periodic electrical testing and inspection, the risk of fire damage to your building, equipment and--most importantly--your employees is far too great to ignore. The injury or death of an employee, client or patron in an electrical fire can not only lead to serious legal trouble for your business but also leave you dealing with grief and guilt. Be sure to cover all your bases and keep your employees, customers and belongings safe from harm. Rest assured that your efforts will pay for themselves in peace of mind.\n\n<b>Benefits From Commercial Electrical Inspection</b>\n\nElectrical installations are an essential part of any property or building. When everything in your business is working just fine, it might seem that hiring an electrical inspector is not worth the investment. However, there are plenty of benefits that your business stands to enjoy from having regular inspections. The benefits include;\n\n<b>Decreased Fire Hazard</b>\nAre you aware that electrical fires are the leading cause of fires in businesses in the nation? This is a fact and electrical inspection is one of the easiest ways you can protect your business from potential losses. A professional inspector will check your wiring for any problems that could cause fire and then fixes them. They will also recommend you on other ways that you can protect your business from fire such as suggesting improving your insulation.\n\n<b>Operation Efficiency is Improved</b>\nAn electrical inspector will not only inspect for faults in the wiring but he will also test for problems that are plaguing your electrical appliances. This could decrease the efficiency of your electrical appliances. Did you know old wiring usually has a tendency to carry out sporadically? Having routine inspections can pinpoint where the problem is and the expert can fix it. By doing this you will decrease your electricity bill and enjoy higher profit margins.\n\n<b>Avoid Appliance Malfunctioning</b>\nA professional inspector will not only focus on your home's wiring but he will also check your appliances. They will check for frays that could lead to malfunctions in the near future. You do not have to write off your malfunctioning appliances; sometimes the problem is as simple as a frayed or misplaced wire. This way you do not have to replace the appliance and you end up investing the money elsewhere.\n\nApart from the above benefits, there are plenty other benefits that your business can enjoy. Such as avoiding penalties for not meeting the electrical standards. An inspector will make sure you meet all necessary standards.\n\n<b>Commercial Electrical Inspection and Testing Service</b>\n\nTests applied, to make sure the safety of electrical installation is as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Continuity - to make sure that the earthing is continuous throughout the circuit.</li>\n \t<li>Bonding Conductors Continuity - to make sure bonding is in place and effective.</li>\n \t<li>Ring Circuit Continuity – make sure the ring is complete.</li>\n \t<li>Insulation Resistance - to test whether there has been any breakdown in insulation to the installation.</li>\n \t<li>Polarity - to check that the installation is correctly wired.</li>\n \t<li>Earth Fault Loop Impedance - to make sure the Zs of the installation.</li>\n \t<li>Earth Electrode Resistance - applies to TT systems only, to test the earthing rods.</li>\n \t<li>RCD testing - to check that Residual Current Device disconnects the supply event of a fault.</li>\n \t<li>Functional testing of isolators and breakers to make sure that they disconnect the supply.</li>\n</ul>\nA detailed Periodic Inspection Report supplied after completing electrical testing containing the following certification:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Guidance Notes for recipients.</li>\n \t<li>Schedule of Inspection and Schedule of Test Results.</li>\n</ul>\nWe give an Electrical Installation Condition Report or Periodic Inspection Report as part of the inspection.",

      "description": "Grounding tests can divided into two categories: those you do to make sure installation meets grounding stipulations. Why the first division?",
      "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer earth ground testing service.</strong></em>\n\nElectrical safety test is essential to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity. Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide.\n\nGround test is the verification that resistance between your grounding system and earth meets the standard specification. Poor grounding not only increases the risk of equipment failure; it is dangerous. Facilities need to have adequately grounded electrical systems so in the event of a lightning strike, or utility overvoltage, current will find a safe path to earth.\n\nOver time, corrosive soils with high moisture content, high salt content, and high temperatures can degrade ground rods and their connections. So although the ground system, when initially installed, had low earth ground resistance values, the resistance of the grounding system can increase if the ground rods are eaten away.\n\nLaboratories are required to maintain earth resistance to less than 1 ohm and earth to neutral voltage to less than 1 volt.\n\nCarelabs follow DEWA recommendation, and adhere to BS7671 IET wiring regulation standards, and as some clients demand, IS 3043 standards also.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>Why is Earth Ground Testing Necessary?</strong></h2>\nThe measurement of ground resistance for an earth electrode system is very important. It should be done when the electrode is first installed, and then at periodic intervals thereafter. This ensures that the resistance-to-ground does not increase over time. The International Electrical Testing Association specifies ground electrode testing every three years for a system in good condition with average up-time requirements.\n\nPoor grounding not only increases the risk of equipment failure; it is dangerous too. Facilities need to have adequately grounded electrical systems so in the event of a lightning strike, or utility overvoltage, current will find a safe path to earth. Over time, corrosive soils with high moisture content, high salt content, and high temperatures can degrade ground rods and their connections. So although the ground system when initially installed had low earth ground resistance values, the resistance of the grounding system can increase if the ground rods are eaten away.\n\n<em><strong>It is recommended that all grounds and ground connections be checked annually as a part of normal predictive maintenance plan.</strong></em>\n\nIf our technician finds an increase in resistance of more than 20 percent, we will investigate the source of the problem and make the correction to the grounding system to lower the resistance.\n\n<strong>How do We Conduct Earth Ground Testing?</strong>\n\nWe use several methods to do a ground test. All of them use at least two reference ground points and a current source.\n<h3><em><strong>Basic tests that we conduct are as follows:</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Soil Resistivity Testing</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Fall-Of-Potential Test</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Ground Impedance Measurements</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Selective Measurement Testing</strong></li>\n \t<li><strong>Clamp-On Testing</strong></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Soil Resistivity Testing</strong>\n\nSoil resistivity testing is the process of measuring a volume of soil to determine the conductivity of the soil. The resulting soil resistivity is expressed in ohm-meter or ohm-centimetre. It is most necessary when\n\ndetermining the design of the grounding system for new installations (green field applications) to meet your ground resistance requirements.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Fall-of-Potential test</strong>\n\nThis method is used to measure the ability of an earth ground system or an individual electrode to dissipate energy from a site. For the 3-pole Fall-of-Potential test, two earth stakes are placed in the soil in a direct line—away from the earth electrode. The fall-of-potential test method is used to measure the ability of an earth ground system or an individual electrode to dissipate energy from a site. The earth electrode of interest must be disconnected. The tester is then connected to the earth electrode. Then, two earth stakes are placed in the soil in a direct line – away from the earth electrode, for the 3-pole fall of potential test. Spacing of 20 m is normally sufficient.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Ground Impedance Measurements</strong>\n\nWhen attempting to calculate possible short-circuit currents in power plants and other high voltage/current situations, determining the complex grounding impedance is important since the impedance will be made up of inductive and capacitive elements.\n\nThis test uses a special transformer to induce an oscillating voltage (often 1.7 kHz) into the grounding system. Unlike the 3-point Test which requires the grounding system to be completely disconnected and isolated before testing, this method requires that the grounding system under test be connected to the electric utilities (or other large grounding system such as from the telephone company) grounding system (typically via the neutral return wire) to provide the return path for the signal. This test is the only test that can be used on live or ‘hot” systems.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Selective Measurement Testing</strong>\n\nSelective testing is very similar to the Fall-of-Potential testing, providing all the same measurements, but in a much safer and easier way. This is because with Selective testing, the earth electrode of interest does not need to be disconnected from its connection to the site! The technician does not have to endanger himself by disconnecting ground, nor endanger other personnel or electrical equipment inside a no grounded structure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Clamp-on Testing</strong>\n\nThe clamp-on methodology is based on Ohm’s Law. A known voltage is applied to a complete circuit and the resulting current flow is measured. The resistance of the circuit can then be calculated. The clamp-on ground tester applies the signal and measures the current without a direct electrical connection. The clamp includes a transmit coil that applies the voltage and a receive coil that measures the current.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Application Sites for Earth Ground Testing are:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cellular sites/microwave and radio towers</li>\n \t<li>Electrical substations</li>\n \t<li>Remote switching sites</li>\n \t<li>Lightning protection at commercial/ industrial sites</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer Earth Ground Testing service.</strong></em>\n\n&nbsp;",

      "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer electrical safety testing services.</strong></em>\n\nElectrical safety testing and certifying has been carried out by safety agencies for almost a century. Electrical and electronic products have changed dramatically over the years, requiring the safety standards to evolve to accommodate the changes in technology.\n\nNot all consumers and manufacturers fully understand the reasons for and importance of proper electrical safety testing. Shock hazards vary in severity and range from a tingling sensation to a lethal jolt. Identifying, correcting, and eliminating shock hazards are the primary reasons for electrical safety testing.\n\nThe equipment used to certify and verify a product’s electrical safety also has changed over time. The technology has improved the work, accuracy, reliability, operator protection, and data capture of test results and critical product knowledge. Advancement to test equipment makes safety testing simpler and more efficient for the manufacturer.\n<h2><strong>Why Do We Need Electrical Safety Testing?</strong></h2>\nThe obvious answer is consumer and operator protection from shock hazards. Shock hazards exist when a voltage and current are accessible to the operator with respect to earth ground.\n\nAccording to OSHA’s Publication 3075, a shock hazard considered to exist at an accessible part in a circuit between the part and ground or other accessible parts if the potential is more than 42.4 V peak and the current through a 1,500-Ω load is more than 5 mA.\n\nStudies recognized that the human body can feel an electrical shock with as little as 1.0 mA of current. Since the human body is not a fixed resistance, the voltage required to produce 1.0 mA of current can vary greatly based on the minimal impedance of the human body under various conditions. Some models use a human body resistance value of 1 kΩ to 100 kΩ.\n\nMany types of consumer electronics are battery powered and carry out at safety extra-low voltages which are not considered a shock hazard to the consumer. However, the chargers for these batteries plug into the wall and have the voltage and current to hazard. As a result, they need testing for electrical safety compliance.\n\nConsider your cell phone. Most of the time it presents no shock hazard to you. However, when you plug it into the charger and connect the charger to a wall outlet, you now have a possible shock hazard. If the insulation between the charger and your phone were to fail, the primary voltage applied to the charger could present on conductive surfaces to which you have access.\n<h2>When Is Electrical Safety Testing Required?</h2>\nSafety testing required at the point of manufacture, before the product is available to the user. Manufacturers of electrical and electronic products must make sure that no hazardous voltages or currents are accessible to the user. They need to test their products to decide if they meet minimum safety levels.\n\nTo analyze this issue, safety agencies, panels of consumer advocates and manufacturers have developed electrical safety standards. These standards make sure that properly designed and constructed products will be electrically safe. They identify types of equipment and the possible shock hazards from each, the minimum requirements for protecting the operator from high voltage and leakage currents, and test methods that decide if the product’s insulation system meets the minimum requirements. There also is the issue of design conformity and liability of the manufacturer.\n\nThe manufacturer’s liability rests on conformance. The manufacturer must make sure conformance by testing 100% of the products it produces. Proof of compliance, including records of tests carried out, required complying with safety agency standards.\n\nThe manufacturer must manage accurate records to make sure it builds products with the same materials and processes on the same basis. The manufacturer must report the safety agency of any changes to the material, design, or process used in producing its product. If the manufacturer makes a change, safety agencies may amend the safety certification. In some cases, the product may need to rectify.\n<h2><b>How Do You Verify and </b><b>Certify </b><b>That Your Products Are Safe?</b></h2>\nTest equipment manufacturers have created equipment specially designed to carry out the tests as defined in the safety agency standards. These tests include the following:\n<h3><b>AC and DC Hipot or Dielectric Withstand Test</b></h3>\nA typical hipot tester or dielectric withstand tester will apply an AC or DC high-voltage potential between the input live AC wires and AC ground or the ungrounded metal enclosure. The test passes if the measured current during this test does not exceed the specified maximal allowable current. Usually, electricity set for 5 mA or less, depending on the safety standard you are following.\n<h3><b>Leakage Current Test</b></h3>\nThere are different types of leakage currents. The maximal allowable leakage current for each of these differs based on the associated safety standard. The most critical standard for leakage current is for medical equipment, IEC 60601-1, where leakage defined as:\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Earth Leakage Current</b>: current flowing from the mains part through or across the insulation into the protective earth conductor.</li>\n \t<li><b>Enclosure Leakage Current</b>: current flowing from the enclosure or parts, excluding applied parts accessible to the operator or patient in normal use through an external conductive connection other than the protective earth conductor to earth or to another part of the enclosure.</li>\n \t<li><b>Patient Leakage Current</b>: current flowing from the applied part via the patient to earth or flowing from the patient via an F-type connector applied part to earth originating from the unintended flow of voltage from an external source on the patient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Insulation Resistance Test</b></h3>\nInsulation resistance test is very similar to hipot testing. In simple terms, it is the applied voltage divided by the measured current resulting in the calculated resistance. It is a method of characterizing the condition of an insulator.\n\nThe most common methods by which insulation may degrade environmental such as heat, cold, humidity and contamination. Many of these insulators are subject to heating from soldering during the manufacturing process and cold or high humidity when not properly stored. In addition, physical damage may occur, causing deformity of the insulation material. Since the thickness of the material can affect insulation resistance, it is common for stretching and compression to change the insulator thickness, which changes the insulation’s resistance. Any sharp object, even something as small as metal filings, also may puncture the insulation.\n\nTypically, insulation resistance measured in MΩ. Measuring the insulation resistance during the manufacturing process make sure that the insulation has not been degraded.\n<h3><b>Ground Bond Test</b></h3>\nGround bond testing confirms the ground connection from the DUT to the earth ground is adequate to carry two times the current rating of the DUT.\n\nThere are further improvements to safety test equipment not defined by the safety standards but based on feedback from manufacturers.\n<h3><strong>Simultaneous Testing of Ground Bond and Hipot</strong></h3>\nWhen manufacturers are producing high volumes of product, even a few seconds saved can equate to improved process times and higher volumes. Simultaneous testing of ground bond and hipot would save the manufacturer process time and money.\n\nMany safety test equipment manufacturers have developed high-voltage and high-current multiplexers to allow multiple products to test from a single safety test device. These are known as scanners and multiplexers, and capacity varies from one or two devices to tens and hundreds of devices.\n<h3><strong>Corona Discharge/Flashover Detection/Breakdown</strong></h3>\nAll hipot and dielectric test equipment has the ability to corona discharge. Safety agencies have not included any necessities to measure the corona discharge for measuring the electricity leakage dynamically in very small levels. It is possible to decide if the unit is in one of the following conditions:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Corona Discharge</strong>: An electrical discharge brought by ionization of a fluid surrounding. A conductor which arise when the potential angle exceeds a certain value but conditions detect a breakdown, and some can detect flashover, but only a few have the added ability to detect are not enough for a complete electrical breakdown. Corona discharge may consider as an early symptom of an impending breakdown.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Flashover</strong>: Leakage of the gas generating plasma discharges is due to electricity flowing through non-conductor such as air.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Breakdown</strong>: A sudden decrease of resistance of an electrical insulator that can lead to a spark through the insulator. This is a brief event such as ESD lead to a continuous arc discharge if protective devices fail to prevent electricity in a high power circuit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Open Short Check</strong></h3>\nIt is important to know if the DUT is properly connected to make sure that the hipot test or insulation resistance test has performed. On test equipment manufacturer has developed a method to make sure the connections to the DUT are normal, open or shorted referred to as the open short check.\n\nBased on the fact, any equipment with conductors separated by an insulator would bring capacitance, applying a high frequency, measuring the impedance and then it can decide if the connection is open, shorted or normal.\n<h3><strong>Ground Fault Interrupt and Operator Protection</strong></h3>\nHipot and dielectric withstand test equipment can present an electrical shock hazard to the test operator. Manufacturers have included ground fault circuit to prevent the operator from being electrically shocked.",

      "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer lightning arrester testing service.</strong></em>\n\nLightning Arrester is the device used to protect the insulation and conductors from damaging effects of lightning on electrical power systems and telecommunication. Typical lightning arrester has a high-voltage terminal and a ground terminal. When a lightning surge travels along the power line to the arrester, electricity from the surge is diverted through the arrester to the earth.\n\nIf protection fails or is absent, lightning that strikes the electrical system introduces thousands of kilo volts that may damage the transmission lines, and can also cause severe damage to transformers and other electrical or electronic devices.\n<h2>Monitoring Total Leakage Electricity</h2>\nPresently the monitoring of total leakage electricity (capacitive and resistive currents) used by many utilities. The Leakage Electricity Monitor is used to measure the Leakage Current of Surge Arrester, and in case of high leakage current Surge Arrester is replaced. However, it is felt that this method is not the fool proof method as the total leakage current, which is purely capacitive, does not signify precisely the health of the Surge Arrester. There are the issues once the Surge Arrester has blasted even though total leakage current value was lower than the limit recommended by the manufacturers.\n\nResistive current is 15-30% of total current and since capacitive and resistive currents are at 90 degree face shift even reasonable change of resistive electricity results in very small increase in the total current. Hence observing total leakage electricity may not show degradation of ZnO disc. Degradation of long linear ZnO disc generally leads to harmonics in the leakage current when system voltage of fundamental frequency applied. Third consonant resistive electric measurement based on filtering of third harmonic element from the total leakage current. Leakage current of the order of about 500 micro amps is generally considered as safe.\n\n<strong>The power loss can be checked by several methods given below:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Using a voltage signal as reference</li>\n \t<li>Compensating the capacitive element by using a voltage signal</li>\n \t<li>Capacitive compensation by combining the leakage current of the three phases</li>\n \t<li>Third order harmonic analysis</li>\n \t<li>Direct determination of the power losses</li>\n \t<li>Third order harmonic analysis with compensation for harmonics in the voltage</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Advance Monitoring System with Resistive Current Element calculations</h2>\nThe use of advanced diagnostic methods greatly decreases the chances of failure &amp; avoids loses of man and money. It is desirable to check condition of Surge Arrester at regular time intervals, by measuring the resistive element of the continuous leakage current in service without decreasing energy of Arrester. Reliable measurements achieved by the instruments based on the principle of “Voltage Signal” as a reference. Regular monitoring of Lightning Arrester has prevented many failures in 66 kV to 765 kV substations. Advanced machineries promote testing even the Surge Arrester is in service, analysing with special current clip-on transformer leakage electricity in the Surge Arrester ground connection. The values of this current normally ranges from fractions of mille ampere to a few mille amperes entire characterized by a resistive current variations whose value is an indicator of deterioration of the Surge Arrester. Leakage of electricity increases due to different stresses like declining and Arrester failures.\n<h2><b>Lightning Protection Systems Testing</b></h2>\nMost building services would simply not function correctly if faults or defects were present but the correct operation of a lightning protection system only becomes obvious when it called upon to protect a structure. For this reason it is even more vital to make sure that fully trained and accredited engineers undertake regular testing and maintenance works on vulnerable structures and sites.\n\nThe current in a lightning strike is likely in the range of 2,000A – 200,000A and so an effective functional system is vital to make sure protection of assets. Majority of structures use BSEN 62305 to report their design, testing and maintenance works related to lightning protection. This standard states a “competent person” should carry out inspections so a good rule of thumb is to look for contractors with third-party accreditation of their ability to design and report on lightning protections systems.\n\nAs large parts of the lightning protection system may  be hidden or inaccessible after completion, it is particularly important, and indeed  necessity of the code, that each element of a lightning protection system should inspect during the construction stages of an installation. Special attention must give to any part of the system that will hide conceal upon completion. These elements may hide for aesthetic reasons or the element would be necessary part of the structure. Inspections should carry out during the installation process but also upon completion and at regular intervals.\n\n<strong>Visual inspection of an installation should take into account the following key points and observations recorded in the detailed inspection report:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspections should repeat at fixed intervals, not exceeding 12 months. If the intervals fixed at 11 months, the system will inspect throughout every season of the year over 11 years</li>\n \t<li>The mechanical condition of all conductors, bonds, joints and earth electrodes should check and any observations noted</li>\n \t<li>If a part is unable to inspect, this should note.</li>\n \t<li>The bonding of any recently installed/added services should check.</li>\n</ul>\nThis section deals with testing the earth electrodes on the system, although reference made to a visual or measured test of any joints or bonds. In practice, it is usual for inspections of components to undertake for testing to carry out.\n<h2>Electrode Testing Method</h2>\nElectrode testing needs experience and knowledge to make sure that any test carried out is meaningful and gives back resistance of electrode under test. Too frequent, Omega handed client information presenting resistance readings that are obviously continuity tests and not true earth-resistance tests. There are two suitable methods of testing lightning protection earths: ‘Fall of Potential/the 61.8% method’ and ‘Dead Earth’. Fall of Potential recommended method and involves the electrode under test; two reference electrodes, a set of leads and four-pole test meter. The electrode under test isolated and connected to the meter shown in figure two for the ‘Fall of Potential’ or figure three for the ‘61.8%’ method. In turn, the test meter connected to the two reference electrodes, which driven nearly 300mm into the ground and located typically 25 and 50 metres away from the electrode under test.\n\nA test made and the direct resistance of the electrode under test recorded on the meter. This method, however, is only practical if the electrode to test located near to virgin ground where test electrodes can drive. In reality, in town and city centres, this is very often not the case. Presence of buried services and pipes may also influence on the test current and the last test value may corrupt as a result of these external influences. Reference electrodes should set away from such potential disturbances. Where practical conditions dictate that the ‘Fall of Potential’ method cannot be used, the ‘Dead/Known Earth’ method is really the only practical alternative. However, it is important to  aware this method is open to error and misrepresentation if the test engineer is not competent to decide suitable dead earth or interpret the readings, which is why it is essential to use an Atlas accredited engineer to undertake tests of this nature.\n<h2>Death Earth Testing Method</h2>\nThe ‘dead earth’ could be any low-resistance earth not directly or fortuitously connected to the earth under test. A connection made from a suitable earth to the test meter, which is in turn connected to the electrode under test will show the lightning protection system acting as the known ‘dead/known’ earth.\n\nA reading is then taken and the ohmic value achieved is effectively the series resistance of the electrode under test and the dead earth. The ‘Dead Earth’ method has some advantages when using the lightning protection system as the low-resistance ‘dead/known’ earth, as, due to the equipotential bonding need to other incoming services, it should give a low-resistance earth path.\n\nTest clamps, or the clamp to the rod in the inspection pit, should open and the meter connected to the rod/rod side of the test clamp and the other side of the test meter connected to the system side of the test clamp. A reading can then be taken, which will show the series resistance of the electrode under test and the rest of the system together with other connected parallel electrical and other earth paths. As these other parallel paths usually have a relatively low combined resistance, the meter reading is effectively resistance of the electrode under test as, if correctly selected, the ‘dead’ earth that used is normally of such low value that it has little impact on final result.\n\nIn addition to providing an ohmic value for the electrode under test, this method also verifies the circuit to the dead earth source and by virtue of this, the electrical condition of the joints in the system. If the connections from the top of the test clamp to the air termination through to the other earths on the system and other parallel paths were loose or damaged, they would give a high resistance, which the meter reading would give back.\n\nThis situation should then be investigated so that any high-resistance joints can address. Where no access to an electrode is possible and, the pile foundations have utilized as the earth termination, it recommended that reference rods installed around the structure and tested upon completion. These do not necessarily form a part of the installation but may use as comparisons against the original pile foundation test results. In short, if the reference rod values have not increased year on year then it can assume neither resistance of the pile foundations.\n\nThe ‘Dead earth’ test method also applies to clamp-on CT type testers where disconnection is not needed, although this type of testing is not always practical. At least two types of test recommend one for each single electrode in isolation and a second for a combined value. The needs of BS EN 62305 are an overall system resistance (excluding bonding to any services) of 10, and each electrode not exceeding 10 times the number of earth electrodes on the system. Any disconnection of the system should carry out with a test to make sure that it is not ‘live’ and no testing should  carry out during storm conditions.\n\nFailure to keep up to date, accurate records can result in hidden parts of a system not being adequately attended to and potentially unnecessary remedial works being proposed and executed, as a full assessment of the installation has not been made. At the time of the annual test and inspection, the following records needed either on site or in an accessible place.\n\n<strong>BSEN 62305 states that the following records should be kept:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Drawings of the lightning protection system</li>\n \t<li>Details of the geology (nature of the soil and details of any special earthen arrangements)</li>\n \t<li>Type and place of the earth electrodes</li>\n \t<li>Test conditions and results obtained</li>\n \t<li>Details of any alterations to the system, including additions and repairs</li>\n \t<li>The name of the person responsible for the system.</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to comply with the Construction Design and Management Regulations, these records should give at completion of the original installation for inclusion in the project Health and Safety file. The person responsible for the upkeep of the building should recover the lightning protection system records from this file and present them to the engineer undertaking the first post-installation inspection and test. Details of the inspections should record so that the needed information can updated and maintained. The programme of tests and inspections would analyse what, if any, maintenance needed. BS EN 62305 states that attention should give to the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Earthing</li>\n \t<li>Evidence of corrosion or conditions likely to lead to corrosion</li>\n \t<li>Alterations and additions to the structure that may affect the lightning protection system (e.g. changes in use of building, installation of crane tracks, erection of radio and television aerials).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ensure Lightning Protection System is Functional</h2>\nStatistics show the UK alone  subjected to around two million strikes per year and, to make sure your lightning protection system is functional when called upon, bearing in mind you have no way of determining when that any maintenance work should be carried out with suitable expediency.\nIn the hands of experienced engineers, proper testing and maintenance of lightning protection systems can become a routine, but very necessary, part of a comprehensive safety programme. At the very least the consequences of not taking a thorough approach could incur unnecessary costs but, given the destructive potential of a lightning strike, those consequences could be much worse.\n\nAll lightning protection systems and static earthen systems must inspect and test by skilled person using calibrated test equipment. By law, this should carry out in line with the relevant standards (BSEN 62305) when the installation completed and on regular basis. Therefore lightning protection testing scheduled at interval of 11 months. Over twelve years, the protection system will test under all seasonal conditions – these can significantly affect performance due to changes in resistance and other characteristics.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Resistance testing</li>\n \t<li>Continuity testing</li>\n \t<li>Ground or soil resistivity testing</li>\n \t<li>Visual inspection</li>\n</ul>\nComplete lightning protection testing would make sure that all structures, key electrical and electronic installations are safe from the effect of lightning strike. You will receive a detailed report that will include not only the findings of the test but also any recommendations for further protection.\n\nMaintenance work and upgrades are required if the testing and inspection reveals any deterioration in the level of protection or if any changes or additions to the structure rendered the existing systems inadequate.\n\nUsing the latest testing equipment, our engineers and technicians are proficient in all necessary inspection and testing process.",

      "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer protection relay testing service.</strong></em>\n<h2><b>What is Protection Relay and Why Testing is Important</b></h2>\nProtection relays are switches that open and close circuits electro-mechanically or electronically. Thus controlling one electrical circuit by opening and closing contacts in another circuit. Factors like Contaminated atmosphere, operating voltage, overload, insulation aging etc. affect the performance of relays.\n\nLike the saying prevention is better than cure, the timely protection relay testing will reveal catastrophic failures which would have prevented the relay from performing when called upon to operate, and properly maintained records will reveal any trends which could lead to such failures. Periodic Maintenance Checks are required to identify equipment failures and degradation in service, so that corrective action can be taken. Because a protection scheme only operates under fault conditions, defects may not be revealed for a significant period of time, until a fault occurs. Regular testing assists in detecting faults that would otherwise remain undetected until a fault occurs.\n<h2><b>How Protection Relay Testing is Done?</b></h2>\nA good set of testing equipment and relay tools are used by our inspectors. Several manufacturers now produce portable relay test sets that will provided excellent results.\n\n<strong>Following are the various steps that we perform for protection relay testing:</strong>\n<h3><strong>Visual Inspection Of Protection Relay Testing:</strong></h3>\nBefore the relay cover is removed, a visual check of the cover can reveal valuable information as well as prevent possible trouble. First, of course, excessive dust, dirt or metallic material deposited on the cover should be noted and removed. Removing such material will prevent it from entering the relay when the cover is removed. The presence of such deposits may call attention to the need for some form of air filtering at the station. Included in this visual inspection should be a check for loose connections, broken studs, burned insulation, and dirty contacts. Each relay should be checked to be in agreement with its setting sheet.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in;\"><b><span style=\"color: black; background: white;\">Mechanical Inspection Of </span><span style=\"color: black;\">Protection Relay Testing<span style=\"background: white;\">:</span></span></b></h3>\nAll connections should be tight. If several connections are found loose, excessive vibration may be indicated and should be corrected. All gaps should be free of foreign material, and should excessive foreign material be found, inspection of the gasket is in order. Moving gaps (contact gaps, armature gaps, etc.) should be measured and the values compared with previous measurements. Should there be a large variation in these measurements, excessive wear may be indicated, in which case the worn parts should be replaced.\n<h3><strong>Electrical Type Protection Relay Testing:</strong></h3>\n<strong>Functional Tests</strong>\nThe functional tests consist of applying the appropriate inputs to the relay under test and measuring the performance to determine if it meets the specification. They are usually carried out under controlled environmental conditions.\n\n<strong>Rating Tests</strong>\nRating type tests are conducted to ensure that components are used within their specified ratings and that there are no fire or electric shock hazards under normal load or fault condition of the power system. This is in addition to checking that the product complies with its technical specification. The following are amongst the rating type tests conducted.\n\n<strong>Thermal Withstand</strong>\nThe thermal withstand of VT's, CT's and output contact circuits is determined to ensure compliance with the specified continuous and short-term overload conditions. In addition to functional verification, the pass criterion is that there is no detrimental effect on the relay assembly.\n<h3><strong>Electromagnetic Compatibility Protection Relay Testing</strong>:</h3>\nThere are numerous tests that are specified to check the working of protection relays and ability to withstand in various working environments. EMC tests determine the impact on the relay under test of high-frequency electrical disturbances of various kinds.\n\n<strong>D.C Interrupt Test</strong>\nThis is a test to determine the maximum length of time that the relay can withstand an interruption in th auxiliary supply without de-energising, e.g. switching off, and that when this time is exceeded and it does transiently switch off, that no maloperation occurs.\n\n<strong>A.C. Ripple on D.C. Supply</strong>\nThis test (IEC 60255-11) determines that the relay is able to operate correctly with a superimposed a.c. voltage on the d.c. supply.\n\n<strong>D.C. Ramp Down/Ramp Up</strong>\nThis test simulates a failed station battery charger, which would result in the auxiliary voltage to the relay slowly ramping down. The ramp up part simulates the battery being recharged after discharging. The relay must power up cleanly when the voltage is applied and not maloperate\n\n<strong>High Frequency Disturbance Test</strong>\nThe High Frequency Disturbance Test simulates high voltage transients that result from power system faults and plant switching operations.\n\n<strong>Surge Immunity Test</strong>\nThe Surge Immunity Test simulates interference caused by major power system disturbances such as capacitor bank switching and lightning strikes on overhead lines within 5km of the substation.\n\n<strong>Power Frequency Interference</strong>\nThis test simulates the type of interference that is caus when there is a power system fault and very high level of fault current flow in the primary conductors or the earth grid. This causes 50 or 60Hz interference to be introduced onto control and communications circuits. There is no international standard for this test.\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in;\"><b><span style=\"color: black;\">Distance Relay Protection Relay Testing:</span></b></h3>\nConsider a 110 KV overhead line. Line is protected with relays on each end. Line connects two substation a and b. using a software we can test the relays. The CMCs are connected to the relays. The Software measure voltage and current based on dynamic simulation of the network. For that the length of the KV line is measured. For a synchronised injection a gps controlled time reference simply connected to test sets using Ethernet cables. After connection is established a test shot is done and checks the performance of relays. When testing distance relays, tests should be made of pickup, angle of maximum torque, contact gap, and clutch pressure.\n<h3><strong>Directional Overcurrent Protection Relay Testing:</strong></h3>\nIn addition to tests recommended for the overcurrent relay, the directional unit of the directional overcurrent relay should be tested for minimum pickup, angle of maximum torque, contact gap, and clutch pressure. A test should also be made to check that the overcurrent unit operates only when the directional unit contacts are closed.\n<h3><strong>Transformer Differential Protection Relay Testing:</strong></h3>\nThere are 2 types of models for transformer differential test. After selecting necessary options for the test in the setting window of the software (like 2nd harmonic transformer vector group pick up etc). It will take us to a test group (stabilisation test, pick up test, 3 phase test etc.). Selecting the test generates corresponding results. A test of minimum pickup should be performed for differential relays. The differential characteristic (slope) should be checked, and where applicable, the harmonic restraint should be tested. Differential relays using ultrasensitive polarized units as sensing devices are slightly affected by previous history, such as heavy internal or external fault currents.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in;\"><b><span style=\"color: black;\">Sync Check Protection Relay Testing:</span></b></h3>\nThis relay monitors the voltages on both sides of a circuit breaker and determines the existence of proper phase angle and voltage before allowing the breaker to close.\n<h3><strong>Solid State Protection Relay Testing:</strong></h3>\nUnlike EMC relay where results can be obtained by a simple continuity tester. Testing with a metre won’t provide necessary load for it to turn on. Connect a load and power supply, and check the voltage of the load terminals with the input ON and OFF. The output voltage will be close to the load power supply voltage with the SSR turned OFF. The voltage will drop to approximately 1 V with the SSR turned ON. This is more clearly checked if the dummy load is a lamp with an output of about 100W. Prime causes of failure in electronic components are heat, vibration, and moisture. Overheating can be caused by voltage transients, current surges, excessive power, or high ambient temperature.\n<h2>Periodic Maintenance Tests for Protection Relays</h2>\nPeriodic testing is necessary to ensure that a protection scheme continues to provide satisfactory performance for many years after installation. All equipment subject to gradual degradation with time, and regular testing is intended to identify the equipment concerned so that remedial actions can be taken before scheme maloperation occurs. However, due care should be taken in this task, otherwise faults may be introduced as a direct result of the remedial work.\nThe self-checking facilities of numerical relays assist in minimising failures due to faulty relays. Defects in secondary wiring and incorrect connections are virtually eliminated if proper commissioning after scheme installation/alteration is carried out. The possibility of incorrect settings is minimised by regular reviews of relay settings. Network fault levels change over time and hence setting calculations may need to be revised. Switching and testing errors are minimised by adequate training of personnel, use of proven software, and well- designed systematic working procedures. All of these can be said to be within the control of the user.\nThe remaining three causes switching errors, application shortcomings, pilot wire faults etc. are not controllable, while two of these three are unavoidable - engineering is not science and there will always be situations that a protection relay cannot reasonably be expected to cover at an affordable cost.\nAlthough protection equipment should be in condition when first put into service, problems develop unchecked and not revealed because of infrequent operation. With digital and numerical relays the in-built self-testing routines can be expected to reveal and annunciate most faults, but this does not cover any other components that, together, comprise protection scheme. Regular inspection and testing of protection scheme is therefore required. It is desirable to carry out maintenance on protection equipment at times when the associated power apparatus is out of service. This is facilitated by co-operation between the maintenance staff concerned and the network operations control centre.",

      "content": "Batteries are used to ensure that critical electrical equipment is always on. There are so many places that batteries are used it is nearly impossible to list them all. Some of the applications for batteries include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Electric generating stations and substations for protection and control of switches and relays</li>\n \t<li>Telephone systems to support phone service, especially emergency services</li>\n \t<li>Industrial applications for protection and control</li>\n \t<li>Back up of computers, especially financial data and information</li>\n \t<li>\"Less critical\" business information systems</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batteries are used extensively and without them many of the services that we take for granted would fail and cause innumerable problems.</span>\n<h2>Why Test Battery System?</h2>\nThere are three main reasons to test battery systems.\n<ul>\n \t<li>To ensure the supported equipment is adequately backed-up.</li>\n \t<li>To prevent unexpected failures</li>\n \t<li>To forewarn/predict death</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>And, there are three basic questions that battery users ask:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What are the capacity and the condition of the battery now?</li>\n \t<li>When will it need to be replaced?</li>\n \t<li>What can be done to improve/ not reduce its life?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Even though there are many applications for batteries, they are installed for only two reasons:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>To protect and support critical equipment during an ac outage</li>\n \t<li>To protect revenue streams due to the loss of service</li>\n</ul>\nEven though a battery is considered only as a source of voltage, it is much more than that. It is obvious that batteries are much more complex than mere voltage sources. There are many parameters to verify the condition of a battery. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is responsible for promulgating battery testing practices. These practices are only recommendations; they are required to be followed by battery manufacturers in the event of a warranty claim. They also make good sense to follow in order to get the most from your battery assets.\n<h3>IEEE Recommended Practices:</h3>\nIEEE has split stationary battery testing into three groups:\n<ul>\n \t<li>IEEE 450 for flooded lead-acid</li>\n \t<li>IEEE 1188 for sealed lead-acid</li>\n \t<li>IEEE 1106 for nickel-cadmium</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How Battery Testing Is Done?</h2>\nThere are various tests for verifying whether the battery is in proper condition or not. Testing is designed to tell us things we want to know about individual cells and batteries. Some typical questions are: Is it fully charged? How much charge is left in the battery? Has there been any deterioration in performance since it was new? How long will it last? Do the safety devices all work?\nIn all of the following tests, and testing in general, the test conditions must be specified so that repeatable results can be obtained, and meaningful comparisons can be made. This includes factors such as method, temperature, DOD, load and duty cycle.\n<h3>Qualification Testing</h3>\nQualification testing is designed to determine whether a cell or battery is fit for the purpose for which it was intended before it is approved for use in the product. This is particularly important if the cell is to be used in a \"mission critical\" application. These are comprehensive tests carried out initially on a small number of cells including testing some of them to destruction if necessary. As a second stage, qualification also includes testing finished battery packs before the product is approved for release to the customer. The tests are usually carried out to verify that the cells meet the manufacturer's specification but they could also be used to test the cells to arbitrary limits set by the applications engineer to determine how long the cells survive under adverse conditions or unusual loads, to determine failure modes or safety factors.\n<h3>Abuse Testing</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of abuse testing is to verify that the battery is not a danger to the user or to itself either by accidental or deliberate abuse under any conceivable conditions of use. Designing fool proof batteries is ever more difficult because as we know, fools are so ingenious.</span>\n<h3>Cycle Testing</h3>\nThis is perhaps the most important of the qualification tests. Cells are subjected to repeated charge - discharge cycles to verify that the cells meet or exceed the manufacturer's claimed cycle life. Cycle life is usually defined as the number of charge - discharge cycles a battery can perform before its nominal capacity falls below 80% of its initial rated capacity. These tests are needed to verify that the battery performance is in line with the end product reliability and lifetime expectations and will not result in excessive guarantee or warranty claims.\n<h3>Electrical Load Test</h3>\nMeasuring voltage tells only part of the story. A load test should also be performed to accurately determine a battery's condition. One of the most common ways of conducting a load test is with a carbon pile load tester. Batteries can be tested inside or outside of the vehicle. (This should be done by a qualified technician only. The load is usually designed to be representative of the expected conditions in which the battery may be used .It may be a constant load at the C rate or pulsed loads at higher current rates or in the case of automotive batteries, the load may be designed to simulate a typical driving pattern. Low power testing is usually carried out with resistive loads. For very high power testing with variable loads other techniques may be required.\n<h3>Thermal Imaging</h3>\nThermal imaging is used to check for \"hot spots\" which would indicate points of high thermal stress in the cell or the battery bank. It is a photographic technique which records the intensity of the infrared radiation emitted by a subject using a special camera. The image on the left is of a lithium ion pouch cell after a prolonged discharge at 4C. In this case the temperature is evenly distributed within the cell and the cell terminals are running cool. These tests can help to identify problems such as overheating, inadequate heat sinking or air flow, undersized current conductors and interference from neighbouring cells or devices. The images can also be used to determine the best location for the temperature sensors used in protection circuits.\n<h3>Electrical Charging and Discharging Test:</h3>\nBy evaluating a battery’s charge/discharge performance, we may effectively simulate the actual working conditions of the battery. The charge process of a battery typically consists of four stages, including the preliminary charge, constant current charge, topping charge and trickle charge. During the discharge process, high-rate discharge does not tend to continue for long. Therefore, simulation of variable pulse discharge current has emerged as a new tendency for developing novel battery charge/discharge testing systems. What’s more, the simulation must be so flexible that it can satisfy various usage requirements of the user.\n\nSince the main battery will be discharged, an event of an outage during the discharge test. The proper way to discharge test a battery is expensive and second battery needs to be brought in and connected in the from the load bank need to be connected to each cell to measure cell voltages. The load test is run typically for eight hours or longer. Then the battery is recharged for about three days to a full charge. After that the second battery can be removed. The entire process can take four days with overtime and at great expense. The benefit of discharge testing is indeed an accurate measure of the battery's capacity and is the only proven method of measuring a battery's capacity.\n<h3>Ohmic Testing</h3>\nThere are different types of ohmic tests.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Resistance-Measures only the resistive value of a battery, The battery also has capacitive and inductive values as well.</li>\n \t<li>Conductance-(Actually Admittance) This is the reciprocal of impedance.</li>\n \t<li>Impedance Testing-Measures the resistive, capacitive and inductive qualities of the battery.</li>\n</ul>\nImpedance testing has a distinct advantage over resistive type testing. When we look at a schematic representation of a battery there are more than just resistive components to that battery. There are also capacitive and inductive characteristics.\n\nAC impedance testing will detect signs of battery aging sooner than purely resistive measurements. Batteries are NOT resisters. Batteries contain both an electrolyte liquid and solid plates. When liquids and solids meet they create a double layer effect. In essence this is a capacitor. As a battery ages the capacitance of the double layer will change well before the resistance of the plates. Resistive testing ignores the capacitive double layer effect.\nOhmic testing is not an absolute test. The measured value is not compared to a standard known good value to determine if the battery is good or bad.(Ohmic testing is NOT a GO/NO GO Test) Ohmic testing is a relative test. The measured value is compared to the previously measured value to see how much it has changed.\n<h3>Capacity Test</h3>\nBattery capacity is a measure (typically in Amp-hr) of the charge stored by the battery, and is determined by the mass of active material contained in the battery. To perform a battery load test to see if service or replacement is necessary. First determine the load by retrieving the CCA (Cold Cranking Amps) from the battery case and reducing this number by half. The discharge rate is one half of the batteries cold cranking rating. Apply this load to the battery for 15 seconds. The battery's voltage must remain above 9.6 volts at 70° F.\n\nFacility managers should be familiar with and follow regulations affecting battery maintenance in order to maintain valid product warranties and avoid unexpected outages. Perhaps more important for a critical facility operator in understanding how best practices can give facility managers added confidence. A proper maintenance program ensures their batteries will support their power generation, transmission and distribution systems, or that their emergency power system is ready when it is needed.\nEnsuring proper battery performance and getting the most out of your investment in this critical asset may take more than just periodic test. That Is why monitoring is a critical component of a preventive maintenance program.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer battery testing and inspection services.</strong></em>",

      "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and provide Automatic Transfer Switch Testing Service.</strong></em>\n\nAutomatic Transfer Switch tests, tests utility power or standby generator power, and conducts the power to critical loads. The NFPA, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), and all major ATS manufacturers publish literature calling for the monthly test of ATSs, yet many facility owners ignore these guidelines and refuse to perform the tests. There are good reasons for both the monthly-test requirement and for the reluctance of many operators to comply.\n\nSome people mistakenly think that monthly tests will shorten the life of a transfer switch, and are therefore reluctant to conduct them. More often, the reason for refusing to test properly is a fear of the two brief interruptions in power that an ATS test entails. There’s no truth to the idea of a regular test shortening the life of an ATS. Any device to be used as a transfer switch—switching a single electrical load between two sources of power—must comply with UL standard 1008, the only standard applicable to this duty.\n<h2>Why is Automatic Transfer Switch Testing Necessary?</h2>\nThe automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a critical system component of the emergency power system, and proper maintenance of an ATS depends on the type of switch and its position in the critical power infrastructure. It is essential to find out whether your ATS is within manufacturers specifications during a planned examination, so that you don’t run the risk of finding this out during an unforeseen outage and you are unable to switch your system to its secondary power.\n\nIntermittent testing of your ATS is the sure-handed method of guaranteeing that your emergency system is as reliable as it can be. Our core group of technicians and engineers have been thoroughly educated and trained on emergency systems, particularly transfer switches. Combining our staff’s training with their vast experience in the field allows for an undeniable recipe for success, where our customers always seek out our expertise and services.\n<h3>Three Primary Reasons Why Monthly Automatic Transfer Switch Test is Required</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A test is an active demonstration that the ATS is still able to function as intended.</li>\n \t<li>An automatic transfer switch is an electromechanical device with moving parts. Like the pistons and crankshaft in an automotive engine, the moving parts in an ATS can seize if they’re left in one position for months or years. Regular exercise will help ensure that moving parts will continue to operate smoothly.</li>\n \t<li>A transfer switch test transfers building load onto the generator for the duration of the generator test. Most standby power generators of more than 100kW are diesel engine driven, and all major diesel generator manufacturers recommend a load of at least 50% of maximum capacity during monthly generator tests. NFPA requires the same thing, for the simple reason that running under a light load is very bad for a diesel engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done during an Automatic Transfer Switch Test?</h2>\n<h3>Following Steps are Performed</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Simulate loss of normal power.</li>\n \t<li>Return to normal power.</li>\n \t<li>Simulate loss of emergency power.</li>\n \t<li>Simulate all forms of single-phase conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Carelabs ATS Testing Checks Include</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check wiring and connections are tight with no discoloration of metal, melted plastic and odour indicating excessive heat.</li>\n \t<li>Verify external operating mechanism is clean and re lubricate if found dirty</li>\n \t<li>Check for any deterioration of wiring insulation such as cuts and abrasions. Replace or repair any damaged wiring.</li>\n \t<li>Check tightness of wiring connections. Re-tighten to specification if any loose wiring found.</li>\n \t<li>Perform insulation resistance tests on all control wiring with respect to ground.</li>\n \t<li>Perform a contact/pole-resistance test.</li>\n \t<li>Verify settings and operation of control devices.</li>\n \t<li>Calibrate and set all relays and timers.</li>\n \t<li>Verify phase rotation, phasing, and synchronized operation as required by the application.</li>\n \t<li>Check ATS main power switching contacts condition. Clean or replace. Replace contactor assembly if necessary.</li>\n \t<li>Exercise the generator set under load.</li>\n \t<li>Test the transfer switch’s automatic control system.</li>\n \t<li>Test all indicators (LEDs) and all remote control systems for operation.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect the outside of the transfer switch for any indication of wear, excessive vibration, leakage, high temperature, contamination or other deterioration.</li>\n \t<li>Verify all external components are in place, firm, tightened and not excessively worn.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect the inside of the transfer switch for any indication of excessive vibration, leakage, high temperature, contamination or any other deterioration.</li>\n \t<li>Verify all internal components are in place, firm, tightened and not excessively worn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How ATS Testing is Done?</h2>\nATS is a pretty simple device. It senses power source and behaves according to how it's set up. Generally it defaults to generator, so with no power all 3 contacts, (30 amp) or 4 contacts, (50 amp) should measure closed and electricity will pass from one contact to the other.\n\nCarelabs process of acceptance testing and maintenance testing standards for your ATS are based on NETA Acceptance &amp; Maintenance Testing Standards.\n\nAutomatic transfers should operate in accordance with manufacturer's design. A general procedure for functional testing of an automatic transfer switch and standby generator is described below.\n<ol>\n \t<li>To begin the test, the normal source circuit breaker is closed. The switch controller will illuminate the Utility Available LED (if equipped) when correct voltage is sensed. If the ATS mechanism is set on Source 1, the Source 1 position LED will also light. The phase to phase voltages at the utility line terminals is verified.</li>\n \t<li>Next, the Alternate source breaker is closed and the engine generator is started. The S2 (Alternate) Available LED will illuminate when correct voltage and frequency levels are sensed. After both sources have been verified, the engine generator is shut down, and the generator's start control is put in the automatic position.</li>\n \t<li>A utility outage is generated by opening the Source 1 (normal side) breaker. The delay to engine start timer begins its timing cycle. After the timer has completed its timing cycle, the engine start contacts close to start the generator.</li>\n \t<li>When generator voltage and frequency reach the preset restore points the Source 2 Available LED illuminates. Simultaneously, the delay to generator timer begins its timing cycle. When the time delay is completed the ATS will transfer to Generator, the S1 position LED goes off, and the S2 position LED illuminates. Systems shall transfer in no less than 10 seconds where failure of the equipment to perform could result in loss of human life or serious injuries.</li>\n \t<li>Source 1 breaker is closed again to re transfer to the normal source. The delay to utility timer begins its timing cycle. When the timer has completed its timing cycle, the ATS will transfer. The S2 position LED goes off, and the S1 position LED illuminates.</li>\n \t<li>The delay engine stop timer will begin its timing cycle. The generator runs unloaded for the duration of this timing cycle. When the timer completes its timing cycle, the generator will stop. The S2 Available LED goes off. A minimum time delay of 5 minutes is provided for unloaded running of the EPS prior to shutdown to allow for engine cool down (NFPA 110). The minimum 5-minute delay is not required on small air-cooled prime movers 15 kW or less.</li>\n</ol>\nA field testing label is applied in accordance with NFPA standards indicating that the transfer switch is electrically and mechanically sound and suitable for service after completing all tests.\n\nWhether you are looking for routine maintenance, or wanting to troubleshoot ATS failure or have emergency systems queries, contact Carelabs.

      "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and provide Contact Resistance Testing Service.</strong></em>\n\nContact resistance testing also known as Ductor testing, measures the resistance of electrical connections - terminations, joints, connectors, busbar sections or cable connections and so on. These can be connections between any two conductors, for example, cable connections or busbar sections. The instrument which is used to perform the ductor test is called an Ohmmeter, and since its function is to perform the ductor test, the ohmmeter is also known as a ductor tester.\n\nThe ductor tester can be found in many variations such as Micro, Mega and Milli- Ohmmeters, static resistance tester or DLRO which stands for Digital Low Resistance Ohm Meter. Is used to measure resistance in different applications of electrical testing. This tester consists of a DC ammeter and a few other components. The test measures the resistance at the micro- or milli-ohm level and is used primarily to verify that electrical connections are made properly, and can detect the following problems:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Loose connections</li>\n \t<li>Adequate tension on bolted joints</li>\n \t<li>Eroded contact surfaces</li>\n \t<li>Contaminated or corroded contacts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why You Need Contact Resistance Test?</h2>\nThe contacts in the circuit breaker needs to checked periodically to ensure that the breaker is healthy and functional. Poorly maintained or damaged contacts can cause arcing, loosing phase, and even fire.\n\nThis test is especially important for contacts that carry large amounts of current (e.g. switchgear busbars) because higher contact resistance can lead to lower current carrying capacity and higher losses. Ductor testing is usually performed using a micro/milli-ohmmeter or low ohmmeter.\n\nMeasurement of the contact resistance helps in identification of fretting corrosion of contacts, and allows contact corrosion to be diagnosed and prevented. Increase in contact resistance can cause a high-voltage drop in the system, which needs to be controlled.\n<h2>What is Done During Contact Resistance Testing?</h2>\n<strong>The two common checks conducted on the contacts of a circuit breaker are the visual inspection check and the contact resistance check.</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>The Visual inspection check involves examining the contacts of the circuit breaker for any pitting marks due to arcing and worn or deformed contacts.</li>\n \t<li>The second check is the contact resistance measurement. This involves injecting a fixed current, usually around 100A, 200A and 300 A through the contacts and measuring the voltage drop across it. This test is done with a special contact resistance measuring instrument. Then, using Ohm's law, the resistance value is calculated. The resistance value needs to be compared with the value given by the manufacturer. The value should also be compared with previous records.</li>\n</ol>\nBoth these tests need to be done together. As there are cases of contacts having good contact resistance yet being in a damaged conditions. Thus, for a contact to be certified healthy, it needs to have a good contact resistance and should clear the visual inspection test.\n<h2>Ductor Tester</h2>\n<strong>There are two types of ductor testers in general:</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Series Type Ohmmeter has 4 resistors, internal battery voltage – E, and output terminals, A and B. When connected the A and B terminals with the R1 and R2 resistors, the battery forms a simple series circuit.</li>\n \t<li>Shunt Type Ohmmeter, used for measuring small values of current resistance. When the A and B terminals are closed, the needle reads zero because the current flows only through the resistor RX. When these two terminals are opened, there is no current flowing through the RX resistor, thus the reading on the ductor tester is marked as infinite.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Conduct Contact Resistance Test?</h2>\n<strong>Test Criteria</strong>\n\nThe criteria for evaluating the contact resistance of electrical connections largely depends on the type of connection (e.g. bolted, soldered, clamped, welded, etc.), the metallic contact surface area, the contact pressure, etc. These will differ by equipment and manufacturer and there is no code or standard that mandates minimum contact resistances. As such, manufacturer recommendations need to be consulted. For example, manufacturers sometimes quote a maximum contact resistance of 10 micro-ohms for large bolted busbar joints.\n\nContact resistance measurement and its application domain are fairly extensive.\n\n<strong>Electrical Connections</strong>\n\nThe electric connections of circuits have various ways and means, such as connected by welding, by pressing, by plug in and blot tightly and so on. To know the quality of a connector and its conduction characteristic, we just need to measure its contact resistance. The contact resistance is often applied in quality testing of switches, relays and PCB pads.\n\n<strong>Machinery Assembly</strong>\n\nAt the aspect of the machinery assembly, the contact resistance of metals contact surface is used in estimating the reliability and tightness of the machinery assembly. The contact resistance is associated with the conduction characteristic of contact surface. The larger area and the less impurity of the pair metals surface is, the better conductivity and the lower resistance are, and vice versa.\n\nBy the ways of measuring contact resistance we can qualitatively analyse the reliability and tightness of the machinery assembly. This technique has been already applied in quality test of the shield assembly for EMC. Measurement methods for different application are not the same.\n<h2>Typical Method for Contact Resistance Test</h2>\nThe four-wire (Kelvin) DC voltage drop is the typical method used by micro-ohmmeters for the contact resistance test, which ensures more accurate measurements by eliminating the own contact resistance and resistance of test leads.\n<ul>\n \t<li>The contact resistance test is performed using two current connections for the injection, and two potential leads for the voltage drop measurement; the voltage cables must be connected as closer as possible to the connection to be tested, and always inside the circuit formed by the connected current leads.</li>\n \t<li>From the measurement of the voltage drop, the microprocessor controlled micro-ohmmeters calculate the contact resistance, while eliminates the possible errors due to thermal EMF effects in the connections (thermal EMFs are small thermocouple voltages which are generated when two different metals are joined together) they will be added to the total voltage drop measured, and will introduce errors into the contact resistance test if they are not subtracted from the measurement through different methods (reversal of polarity and averaging, directly measuring of thermal EMFs magnitude, etc).</li>\n \t<li>If low resistance readings are obtained when testing the breaker contact resistance using a low current, then we re-test the contacts at a higher current. Why would we benefit using a higher current? A higher current will have the ability to overcome connection issues and oxidation on terminals, where a lower current may produce false (higher) readings under these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is very important in the contact resistance test to maintain consistent measurement conditions, to be able to compare with previous and future results for trending analysis. Therefore, when taking periodic measurements, the contact resistance test must be performed in the same position, with the same test leads (always with the calibrated cables supplied by the manufacturer), and in the same conditions, to be able to know when a joint, connection, weld or device will become unsafe and makes\n\nConclusion Measurements of thermal conductivity are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in hydrostatic pressure (analogous to electrical voltage) occurs when fluid flow transitions from one channel to another.\n\nContact resistance tests provide information about how healthy the contacts are and their ability to handle their rated current.\n\nThe maximum contact resistance is verified against manufacturers’ specifications. Rated current should not be exceeded and testing at 10% of the rated current is recommended.\n\nThe minimum DC test current is used according to manufactures specification; however, the IEC and ANSI recommended levels are: 50 A IEC 60694 100 A ANSI.",

      "content": "Running your generator efficiently is the key to ensuring its longevity and avoiding unnecessary downtime. Standby generators can remain unused for long periods of time, awaiting a power cut before smoothly intercepting it. Even a regular no-load test leaves the standby generator prone to faults incurred through under-use or neglect. These diesel standby generators that run rarely and or lightly loaded can build up fuel deposits in parts of the engine over time, which may leave your standby generator with reduced output capacity when it is needed. Policies. Things like light loading a generator or neglecting scheduled maintenance can lead to unexpected operating costs, excessive wear and increased emissions.\n\nA load test in this situation will ensure that your standby generator will support your load when the occasion arises. Annual load testing is imperative to confirm your generator is capable of handling the demanded load when necessary, and some insurance companies demand it as part of their <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">policy agreement.</span>\n<h2><b>Why is Generator Load Bank Testing Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nIn the event of a power failure you want to have peace of mind that your backup generator power supply will spring into action seamlessly on a moment's notice. But what happens when the power goes out and your generator fails function as expected? The result can often be costly and sometimes catastrophic depending upon your application. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThis is precisely the reason generator load bank testing is an essential piece of a comprehensive preventative generator maintenance plan, which you should ideally have conducted on your genset(s) each year. Load bank testing helps to ensure that your generator will be fully dependable and operational, as well as completely capable of the highest possible load it may be required to handle at any critical point in time. Load testing your emergency standby generator system should be part of a standard planned maintenance program for all systems.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Following are the Reasons to Test Your G</b><b>enerator</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>To make sure the generator will perform as designed, when it is needed most. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Monitoring the exercise period to ensure the generator starts and runs as programmed is also important, but does not ensure the generator will operate as designed.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>As the generator ages, the possibility of weaknesses in the system will rise.

A generator load bank test involves an examination and assessment of a genset.  It verifies that all primary components of the generator set are in proper working condition. It involves firing up a standby or prime power generator and running it under an artificial load at its maximum capacity for a specified period of time. Data is recorded that offers a more thorough look into the health of the genset on the whole. The test verifies that the generator is capable of handling incrementally higher kW loads, that it is still capable of accommodating its maximum specified load, and that it can work for an extended period of time.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThe equipment used to conduct a load bank test produces artificial loads on the generator by bringing the engine to an appropriate operating temperature and pressure level. This is especially important for standby and emergency generator sets that do not run very often and/or may not be exposed to carrying heavy loads on a frequent basis.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How </b><b>is</b><b> a Load Bank Test Work</b><b> Carried Out</b><b>?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nPlacing a 100 percent capacity load on a generator and allowing it to run for a while not only brings to light any problems in the generator and in the engine and its cooling system; it also benefits the engine by properly seating the rings and dislodging build-up in the combustion chambers and on the valves. Diesel engines especially need a periodic load test in order to maintain performance and fuel economy.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nAt Carelabs we dispatch a portable load bank to the site, allowing the generator to be load-tested safely in controlled conditions, at a time that suits your business.

If possible, we use 220 volt resistive loads, such as large space heaters or water heaters. They simplify this step because they apply the load to each leg equally.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\n<b>Step 4</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\n</span>The amperage of each leg is checked with the ammeter, and the voltage from each leg to neutral is also checked with the VOM set to read AC volts. For a 110/220 volt single phase generator, the voltage of each leg should fall between 105 and 125 volts, and the current should be half of the rated watt output divided by the voltage, for each leg.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\n<b>Step 5</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\n</span>The generator is monitored while maintaining this load for the duration of the test. We watch for overheating, listen for unusual noises, and monitor the output. If a problem develops, the generator is shut down quickly to minimize damage, and the generator is repaired before returning it to service. How long the test should continue depends upon the type of generator. Light-duty portable generators should not be run at full load for more than three to four hours. Contractor grade generators should be able to run for eight hours. Continuous duty air or water cooled generators should run 24 hours. Larger industrial quality diesel generators should ideally be run under full load for about a week.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\n<b>Step 6</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\n</span>Last we remove the loads gradually, and allow the generator to run under light load for one hour.

      "content": "Developed early in the 20th century, the insulation resistance (IR) test is the oldest and most widely used test for assessing the quality of insulation. Insulation Resistance Test is the second test required by the electrical safety testing standards. The Insulation Resistance Test consists in measuring the Insulation resistance of a device under test, while phase and neutral are short circuited together. The measured resistance has to be higher than the indicated limit from the international standards. A megohmmeter (also called insulation resistance tester, teraohmmeter) is used to measure the ohmic value of an insulator under a direct voltage of great stability.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nInsulation cannot be perfect in the same way that something cannot be frictionless. This means that there will always be a little bit of current travelling through. This is known as “leakage current”. It’s acceptable with good insulation, but if the insulation deteriorates, leakage can start causing trouble. So what makes “good” insulation? Well, it needs a high resistance to current, and it needs to be able to sustain high resistance for a long time<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why Insulation Resistance Test is Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nInsulation starts to age as soon as it's made. As it ages, its insulating performance deteriorates. Any harsh installation environments, especially those with temperature extremes and/or chemical contamination, accelerates this process. This wear and tear can reduce the electrical resistivity of the insulating materials, thus increasing leakage currents that lead to incidents which may be serious in terms of both safety (people and property) and the costs of production stoppages. Thus it's important to identify this deterioration quickly so that corrective steps can be taken. In addition to the measurements carried out on new and reconditioned equipment during commissioning, regular insulation testing on installations and equipment helps to avoid such incidents through preventive maintenance. These tests detect ageing and premature deterioration of the insulating properties before they reach a level likely to cause the incidents described above.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThis test is often used as a customer acceptance test, with minimum insulation resistance per unit length often specified by the customer. The results obtained from IR Test are not intended to be useful in finding localized defects in the insulation as in a true HIPOT test, but rather give information on the quality of the bulk material used as the insulation. Wire and cable manufacturers use the insulation resistance test to track their insulation manufacturing processes, and spot developing problems before process variables drift outside of allowed limit.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why is a Multimeter Not used for Measuring Insulation Resistance?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nAlthough there is a degree of similarity between a multimeter and megger, the insulation resistance is measured using a Megger (or a similar device), because it’s able to generate a high voltage that creates a moment of stress in the insulation.  Insulation resistance is calculated usually in Mega- or Tera-ohms.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nIn conclusion, a multimeter measures the electrical resistance of a conductor (coil), while a Megger measures the insulation resistance of an isolated group (two coils relative to mass), something that a multimeter is unable to do.<b> </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How is Insulation Resistance Measured?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nInsulation resistance measurement is done using an IR tester. This is a portable tool that is more or less an ohmmeter with a built in generator that’s used to produce a high DC voltage. The voltage usually measures at least 500V, and causes a current to flow around the surface of the insulation. This gives a reading of the IR in ohms. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nInsulation resistance measurement is based on Ohm's Law. (R=V/I). By injecting a known DC voltage lower than the voltage for dielectric testing and then measuring the current flowing, it is very simple to determine the value of the resistance. In principle, the value of the insulation resistance is very high but not infinite, so by measuring the low current flowing, the megohmmeter indicates the insulation resistance value, providing a result in kW, MW, GW and also TW (on some models). This resistance characterizes the quality of the insulation between two conductors and gives a good indication of the risks of leakage currents flowing. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nWell, if we get a high number of IR, you have some good insulation. However, this is not everything – a variety of factors can affect the IR, including temperature and humidity. We will have to do a number of tests over time to make sure the IR value stays more or less the same. Value of insulation resistance is often expressed in gigaohms [GΩ].<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA Good Insulation is when megger reading increases first then remain constant.

For many years, maintenance professionals have used the one-megohm rule to establish the allowable lower limit for insulation resistance. The rule may be stated: Insulation resistance should be approximately one megohm for each 1,000 volts of operating voltage, with a minimum value of one megohm.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Time-Resistance Method </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h3>\nThis method is fairly independent of temperature and often can give us conclusive information without records of past tests.

An effective connection to the system ground within the fixed installation of the premises ensures safety.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Insulation Test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nThe insulation test is used to confirm that there is separation between the live conductors (live and neutral) and any accessible conductive parts. Generally, insulation testing is carried out by applying a known test voltage (500 V DC) and measuring the resistance. On sensitive equipment (IT for example) 500 V may cause damage, and so be unsuitable. Therefore, it may be substituted with a low-voltage (250 V) insulation test, a touch current test or an alternative leakage current test.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Differential Leakage Test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nThe differential leakage current (also called protective conductor current) test measures the difference in current between the live and neutral conductors and determines if any current is flowing to earth. Normally, appliances should have no, or very little, earth leakage current. Class II (double insulated) appliances could exhibit earth leakage through their mountings or by operator contact. During the test, the actual mains voltage is measured at the appliance socket. To ensure that the equipment is safe even when the mains supply rises to its maximum permitted value, the PAT calculates and displays the leakage current that would flow at this value.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Leakage current test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nIt is performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for Class I appliances or 1mA for Class II appliances. Alternatively, we measure insulation resistance values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V dc, to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the metal oxide varistors (MOVs), or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression has triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs, or EMI suppression, at 250 V dc.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Load Test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nThe load test (also called the operational or VA test) measures the power consumption of the equipment when running.

These are described below:</strong>\n<h3><b>Method 1 for Polarity Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThis method is exactly the same as test method one for ‘Continuity Of Protective Conductors’ if we take a lighting circuit, by putting a temporary link between phase and circuit protective conductors (cpc), at the consumers unit and our instrument at lamp holders themselves, we are creating a circuit. When we operate the light switch, the instrument changes, and then changes back to the original reading on operation of the switch again. If the reading did not change, then the switch is likely to be connected in the Neutral. (Not good!) With a little foresight this could be carried out at the same time as the continuity test. The only difference being, for radial circuits every point must be tested. The main benefit with this is it allows you to conduct 2 tests at the same time, polarity and R1 + R2. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Method 2 for Polarity Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThis method, like wise is similar to test 2 of the continuity test, we simply use a wander lead as the return lead. There is little use for this method, within the polarity test. Method 1 is less clumsy, and is far more flexible and useful. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How is Polarity Test Done?</b> <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<strong>We perform following steps for polarity testing:</strong>\n<h3><b>Step 1:  Polarity by Visual Inspection</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nBy using our knowledge and sight, correct termination of cables relating to core colours can be established.

polarity test to ensure that all single pole devices (fuses, switches and circuit breakers) are connected in the PHASE conductor only. We cannot simply trust that the electrician(s) have connected things up the right way; everyone makes mistakes, even if it’s your own work. “Basically it is a test that creates a circuit using the phase conductor and the single pole device in question, breaking the circuit when operating the device, means that the reading on the instrument will change, and thus confirming that that device must be connected in the phase conductor.\n\nIt ensures apparatus connected to the circuit is connected correctly, and does not become damaged. Plug in tester, and ensure the polarity is correct according to the charts on the test instrument.

It requires connections to be made to the live, neutral and earth conductors, and typically uses a test current of 15 mA or less. Its benefits are that there is no need to bypass RCDs and RCBOs during testing, which saves time, and that it does not trip MCBs. There are, however, a few limitations.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Prospective Short Circuit Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h3>\nIt helps to ensure that in the event of a short circuit, the cable tested can carry enough fault current, to trip the MCB or blow a fuse, as quickly as possible  (and within the stated regulation guideline times of 0.4 seconds for socket outlets (portable equipment) and 5 seconds for fixed equipment). A PSC test calculates the current that will flow in the event of a short circuit fault between the live conductors. That is, Line and Neutral on a single phase installation or Line to Line/ Line to Neutral on a three phase installation. Result should be recorded in hundreds of amps.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Residual Current Device Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h3>\nRCD testing is the process of safely \"tripping\" your RCD to ensure it will operate quickly should there be an electrical incident.

Your RCD is designed to trip, or switch off all the power to that circuit. It is done to ensure that the RCDs installed will trip fast enough in the event of a fault, to prevent electrocution.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nTo do RCD testing plug in test equipment (set at the rating of the RCD), and set the test at 0.5 of the RCD's rated tripping current - the RCD must not trip out.

The measured resistance is intended to indicate the condition of the insulation or dielectric between two conductive parts, where the higher the resistance, the better the condition of the insulation. Ideally, the insulation resistance would be infinite, but as no insulators are perfect, leakage currents through the dielectric will ensure that a finite (though high) resistance value is measured.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why Megger Testing is Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nInsulation resistance quality of an electrical system degrades with time, environment condition i.e. temperature, humidity, moisture and dust particles.

The testing device only goes between 500 and 1,000 volts, which is relatively low. Due to the low voltage, some punctures in insulation go undetected. It generally provides information about the leakage current and whether insulation areas have excessive dirt or moisture as well as the amount of moisture, deterioration and winding faults.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Done During Megger Testing?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nWe can test your circuits for the existing connections or melted fault areas that may have occurred during a fire event.

These may be caused by natural phenomena,  by falling objects such as trees, by animal contacts or chewing; inadvertent acts by plant maintenance personnel, or other acts of humans; or by conditions produced in the system itself, such as switching surges, load swings, or equipment failures. Protective devices must therefore be installed on power systems to ensure continuity of electrical service, to limit injury to people, and to limit damage to equipment when problem situations develop.

Properly working protection devices help to maintain the safety of the system and to safeguard assets from damage. In order to ensure reliable operation, protective relays as well as recloser controls must be tested throughout their life-cycle, from their initial development through production and commissioning to periodical maintenance during operation.\n\nCarelabs equipment is ideal for each of these life-cycle phases and for any environment.

The test set will pass enough current to check any desired calibration point. The breaker must be de-energized before checking the operation of the solid-state trip units.

That increases safety two-fold by preventing electrocution, and allowing some lights and power to remain on in the building.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA Residual Current Device is designed to protect against the risks of electrocution and fire caused by earth faults.  For example, if you cut through the cable when mowing the lawn and accidentally touched the exposed live wires or a faulty appliance overheats causing electric current to flow to earth. RCD’s are very sensitive and will activate within 10 to 30 milliseconds stopping the flow of electricity.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How Often Should RCD Testing Occur?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nRCD testing has to be completed every three months, and documented, to remain in compliance. There is a test button on the device that has to be pressed to determine if the switch is working correctly. It is working properly if the power goes off. If the power does not go off, an electrician has to be called to re-test the switch, repair it, or replace it. It is strongly recommended that all homeowners, even those not selling the property have the devices installed for safety.

Any load or appliances should be disconnected prior to testing. RCD test instruments require a few milliamperes to operate; this is normally obtained from the phase and neutral of the circuit under test. When testing a three-phase RCD protecting a three-wire circuit, the instrument’s neutral is required to be connected to earth. This means that the test current will be increased by the instrument supply current and will cause some devices to operate during the 50% test, possibly indicating an incorrect operating time. Under this circumstance it is necessary to check the operating parameters of the RCD with the manufacturer before failing the RCD test, the manager must reset the device by pressing the appropriate button. Thermal Scanners is able to carry out all your RCD Testing requirements and upon completion, issues you with a Comprehensive Report and Compliance Certificate.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How are RCDs Tested?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nThe wiring regulations require the residual device providing additional protection to disconnect within 40 milliseconds when tested at 5 times the current they are designed to operate within normal circumstances.

      "description": "Circuit Breaker Testing is vital to make sure a safe and reliable performance of the circuit. A circuit breaker might remain idle for many years",
      "content": "<h2>Main Task of Circuit Breakers</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>When sealed, they must let the current flow as effectively as possible</li>\n \t<li>When open, they must insulate the contacts from one another as effectively as possible</li>\n \t<li>In the event of a malfunction, they must disconnect the fault current as quickly and reliably as possible, thereby protecting all subsequent equipment</li>\n</ul>\nA circuit breaker might remain idle for many years, and then, in the occasion of a malfunction, it has to cut off fault currents of several kiloamps reliably within just milliseconds. Typical errors that occurs on circuit breakers are short circuits in the coils, for example because of damaged mechanical connections, because of worn contacts, or damaged insulation. Thus, circuit breakers needs to be carefully tested regularly.\n<h2>Why Circuit Breaker Testing is Done?</h2>\nThe circuit breakers should carry out the crucial protective function of attaching and detaching the electrical power in a consistent manner; this needs proving their consistency on field tests while installation and with periodical maintenance tests during its lifespan to avoid expensive failures and glitches that could even compromise the safety of the substation.\n\nBy studying the current used by the trip coil throughout the circuit breaker’s operation, it is likely to find out if there are any mechanical or electrical issues. Most times, such issues can be limited to assist in finding the core cause. Optionally, checking the tripping supply’s voltage through the operation can help find out problems rising with tripping batteries.\n<h3>Part of a diagnostic maintenance program includes:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Finding an early indication of possible problems</li>\n \t<li>Preventing problems rather than picking up pieces</li>\n \t<li>Building up a test record database for trending</li>\n \t<li>Picking out the bad actors</li>\n</ul>\nPerforming Timing Tests is the best way to verify the control circuit, check motion of the moving parts, validate time of operation, verify manufacturer specifications, determine contact wear, demonstrate results of maintenance and assess overall breaker capability.\n<h2>What is Done During Circuit Breaker Testing?</h2>\nIn comparison to other electrical equipment such as transformer or machine, testing of circuit breakers is much more challenging because the short circuit current is larger. Separate circuit breaker test equipment are employed to verify the working and state of circuit breakers on the power systems.\n\nHow to test a circuit breaker consists of a lot of different test techniques and type of testers; there are few primary deliberations on how to test a circuit breaker, which guides to various preferred functions in the test set, the way to test a circuit breaker varies with the type of breaker (MV/HV/LV) and depends on the element to be verified to find out potential performance problems (tripping time, synchronism, etc.).\n\nFor testing a circuit breaker, it is essential that a vast information about the breaker is available, about how it works, reference values of previous tests, its tolerances or initial values with which to compare the actual results, sometimes defined by a rated timing graph. In this way, the way to test a circuit breaker becomes a trending analysis since test results are not always definitive but have meaning just when compared to previous data or results.\n<h2>How is Circuit Breaker Testing Done?</h2>\nRoutine field testing doesn't necessarily consists of complicated equipment in order to check a circuit breaker is in operational state. Few regulations and suggestions for these tests consists of regular maintenances and checking that that circuit breaker performance is in order with manufacture’s calibration curves. It is vital that these tests are performed under organised conditions at ambient temperature so will be no alterations in the data. For every breaker resistance testing, load and line conductors must be detached. If not then the test calculations will also consists of the traits of the connected circuit.\n<h3>Few of the routine maintenance tests are:</h3>\n<strong>Insulation Resistance Test\n</strong>Resistance testing is important for checking that the insulating material, which renders the moulded cases, of breakers are working properly. In order to check for insulation resistance, an equipment called as “megger” is employed. A megger applies an identified DC voltage to a provided wire for a determined period of time in order to check the resistance within the insulation on that specific wire or winding. It is vital that voltage is applied because resistance tested with an ohm meter may differ if there are no potential differences existing. It must also be observed that if you apply a voltage that is too large for that insulation to endure, then you might potentially harm the insulation. Meggers are rated and have particular settings that range from 300V to 3000 V. Carelabs technicians and engineers are skilled in megger usage and insulation resistance testing.\n\n<strong>Connection Test\n</strong>Connection testing is important to make sure that an appropriate electrical connection exists and to find out any indications of overheating marked by discoloration. It is vital that electrical connections are correctly set up to the Circuit Breaker to avoid and decrease overheating. Carelabs concentrates on connection testing and are skilled enough to know that aluminium connectors are plated and should not be harshly cleaned. Carelabs will fix and substitute broken aluminium connectors (lugs) to avoid future damage.\n\n<strong>Contact Resistance Test\n</strong>Usual wear and tear of contacts in the Circuit Breaker rises after lengthy use. A simple method to find out traces of deterioration within the Circuit Breaker is to calculate the resistance across each pole of the breaker. Carelabs induces a current through a CB and uses a voltmeter to find out the voltage across the breaker. By understanding the current induced and the\n\nmeasured voltage, Carelabs is able to determine the contact resistance based on ohms law. Signs of irregular conditions within the CB such as corrosion and corruption of contacts are obvious if there are too much millivolt drops across the breaker. The contact resistance test is important in finding out whether or not a CB is still suitable for operation.\n\n<strong>Overload Tripping Test\n</strong>Overload tripping modules of Circuit Breakers can be checked by injecting (3*100) % of the breaker rating into every pole of the circuit breaker to establish that it will open involuntarily. The reason for this test is to make sure that the CB will work. Carelabs refers to NETA standards for trip times that are suitable for the overload tripping test. When attempting to determine tripping characteristics other than whether or not the CB works or not, it is clever to check with manufacturer’s trip curves and instruction manuals.\n\n<strong>Instantaneous Magnetic Tripping\n</strong>It is much more appropriate to find out that the magnetic feature is working or not and will trip the CB rather than determining the precise value at which the instantaneous magnetic feature works.\n<h2>Benefits of Circuit Breaker Testing</h2>\n<strong>Circuit Breaker Testing is vital to make sure a safe and reliable performance of the circuit:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Quick and easy to perform on site</li>\n \t<li>Circuits can be tested on or off load</li>\n \t<li>Tests performance of whole tripping cycle</li>\n \t<li>Tests overall timing of tripping system</li>\n \t<li>Identifies need for maintenance</li>\n</ul>",

      "content": "The angular force needed to twist something is called torque. For example, force needed to rotate the steering wheel as you around a corner, or the force supplied by a helicopter engine to rotate its propeller are examples of torques. Torque testing includes determining the quantity of torque being supplied to an object. Using the proper torque is a vital part of a consistent bolted joint.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why is Torque Testing Needed?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nBuilding a big, complicated circuit often includes hundreds of fasteners, mainly bolts or screws that are stiffened by a torque driver. Generally, tightening the fasteners excessively can lead to exceeding tolerances of the fastener. For example, you may end up removing some of the threads on a screw, making it defective. If the forces operating on the metal surpass its plastic limit, it may end up expanding and not returning to its initial dimensions, which means that it will not keep the structure in shape.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThus fasteners should be tested to check the joint has been tightened to the correct torque requirements. Verification makes sure that the quality requirements are fulfilled. By calculating and examining the torque characteristics in such applications it is achievable to precisely find out not only the quality of the circuit, but also the main reason of a broad variety of flaws.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nLoose or weak connections may function reasonably for a time period, but sooner or later they will undergo thermal runaway that will cause high temperatures causing equipment impairment and, sometimes fires. There have seen numerous occurrences of failures and fires that were proved to be triggered by loose connections. For many electricians, the idea of torquing terminations is a recent concept, but the benefits are clear: safer installations.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nOne should not look loose connections alone but over tightened or stripped connections should also be noticed.  A stripped connection would not be clear by visual inspection alone.

Both loose and overly tightened connections generates a danger of breakdown.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Done During Torque Testing?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nAll the connections must be tightened according to the standards using correct equipment.

The theory of “more torque is better” is false. Applying a higher torque value than stated may lead to damage to the connection or equipment. Torquing must certainly not be done on energized equipment; if it must be performed, make sure that appropriate PPE is used. Before energizing the facility, electrician must express that he or she has appropriately torqued the terminations. Loose electrical connections are one of the leading causes for electrical failures. Tools are used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe torque values must be found out as soon as the bolts are fastened and in advance to product painting or heating. This is since precise readings depend on friction existing below the nut surfaces and in the bolt threads. The torque value reading will be incorrect if the bolt is unprotected from varied environmental surroundings or is placed to sit for a long time. You can expect as much as a 21% discrepancy if a bolt is left to stand for around 48 hours.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How is Torque Testing Performed?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nEvery bolt has a torque scheme or value that makes sure hidden failures are eradicated and that the protection, consistency and characteristic of your product are not compromised.

Using this technique to find out the torque in an installed fastener includes turning the fastener in a clockwise route, as you would when fastening it. The aim is to attempt to make it move a little, and then record the torque reading when this first happens. It’s vital that you don’t move the fastener too much, mainly if it’s too tight and is within its boundaries. After fastening the bolt, utilise a torque measuring device to mark off the tightened bolt and the workpiece.

      "content": "Switchgear is an arrangement of electrical cut-off switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to regulate, guard and detach electrical gear. Switchgears are utilized both to de-energize equipment to permit work to be performed and to clear errors downstream. This type of equipment is directly linked to the reliability of the electricity supply.\n<h2>Why Switchgear Testing is Done?</h2>\nBecause of component failures short circuits can cause product breakdown, danger to human life resulting in damage to company reputation. In Switchgear and electrical wiring fittings testing is compulsory to make sure product safety and agreement with international regulations/ standards. Regular inspection and testing of switchgear is critical in electrical asset management. It can prolong equipment life and prevent unscheduled outages, and safety. It can also improve reliability, reduce maintenance costs and increase predictability.\n\nTesting assists in spotting the faults that may be inbuilt in particular equipment. Hence it enables the user to take a decision whether to use or not to use the equipment under known circumstances. The aim of electrical testing on key equipment is mostly to make sure that the gear will work as required, when it is installed and energized within its specified voltage and load conditions. This is basically like an insurance premium to be spent before the equipment is accepted in a particular installation. One other aim is to build a set of base line test results of the equipment that can be compared in future to detect wear and tear and therefore for taking remedial actions.\n<h2>What is Done During Switchgear Testing?</h2>\nCarelabs offers safety testing services for a wide range of switchgear products. Our reports are highly renowned in UAE. Our services include electrical test (High voltage, insulation resistance, short-circuit), temperature-rise test, mechanical strength test, endurance test, environmental test (Ageing, humidity, glow-wire)\n\nWe perform tests on these products: -voltage switchboards / tap-off boards, busbar trunking systems, distribution boards / consumer units, isolating switches / disconnectors, low-voltage fuses, circuit breakers - MCB / RCCB / RCBO, steel surface cable, trunking, fire alarm panels etc.\n<h2>How is Switchgear Testing Performed?</h2>\n<strong>Following tests are performed:</strong>\n\n<strong>Visual inspection and Mechanical inspection\n</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspect switchgear and all components for any physical damage / defects.</li>\n \t<li>Check nameplate information for correctness.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect enclosures for proper alignment, foundation fixing, and grounding and vermin entry.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect all covers, panels’ section and doors for paintwork and proper fit.</li>\n \t<li>Examine all the transport locks are detached.</li>\n \t<li>Examine for effortless and correct movement of rails and guides, racking systems, shutter, rollers,.</li>\n \t<li>Check proper alignment of the primary and secondary contacts.</li>\n \t<li>Check operation of all mechanical interlocks.</li>\n \t<li>Check tightness of all bolted connections.</li>\n \t<li>Check for correct phasing connection of bus bar.</li>\n \t<li>Perform mechanical check and visual inspection for breaker / Contractor as per section.</li>\n \t<li>Perform mechanical check and visual inspection for instrument transformers as per section.</li>\n \t<li>Perform mechanical check and visual inspection on all disconnect / grounding switches as per section.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Insulation Resistance Test\n</strong>The insulation resistance test is a DC evaluation test of the insulation and gives a reliable indication of the presence of moisture, contamination or breakdown in the insulation. This test also establishes a benchmark for future comparative tests.\n<ul>\n \t<li>It includes panel enclosure, busbar, CT and circuit breaker.

      "description": "Fixed Electrical Testing involves the testing of electrical services and systems that conduct electricity around a building.",
      "content": "Fixed Electrical Testing involves the testing of electrical services and systems that conduct electricity around a building. It covers all of the hard wiring in a building and includes items such as main panels, distribution boards, lighting, socket outlets, air conditioning and other fixed plant.\n<h2>Why is Fixed Electrical Testing Required?</h2>\nThe best way to find out if your electrical equipment is safe is to have it inspected and tested by a person who is competent to do so. Many of the potential faults in electrical equipment can be identified with thorough inspection and testing by a competent engineer, but electrical equipment should be tested more thoroughly on a regular basis. The test should be carried out often enough that there is little chance that the equipment will become unsafe between tests. Equipment for use in harsh conditions may need very regular testing whilst equipment in clean, dry, well-controlled environments may need less regular testing. Thus it ensures compliance with the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 and IEE Wiring Regulations. It reduces costly failures and downtime of the electrical installation. It aids plant managers to budget for electrical work.\n<h2>What is Done in Fixed Electrical Testing?</h2>\nTesting electrical installations is always an interesting task. We often get to see the nuts and bolts of most buildings during this process. The whole purpose of electrical inspection and testing is to determine if the wiring within a building is safe for continued use. Referencing the current wiring regulations and the regulations in force at the time of the original installation. It is important to note that we can’t or at least should not make recommendations based on what our ideal installation would look like. Safety is the prime goal and anything unsafe or something that could develop into an unsafe installation is highlighted and coded within our documentation referencing the regulations that apply to such issues. Things that do not meet the current wiring regulations but that are not unsafe or dangerous will be coded or noted for information during future testing or to bring the installation right up to date.\n<h2>How fixed electrical testing is done?</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Programming of Works and Progress Meeting</h3>\nA programme of the sequence of works should be agreed between the users and Carelabs. Prior to commencement on site, a pre-contract meeting with the client end users and our team will be scheduled. The pre-contract meeting will be to discuss the detailed day- to-day arrangements for safe methods of working. Notes of any decisions taken will be circulated and incorporated into the contract arrangements.\n<h3>Step 2: Method of Inspection and Testing</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>First our team shall carry out a Risk Assessment and generate a Method Statement</li>\n \t<li>We inspect and test all circuits and make all reasonable attempts to identify the full extent of the circuit. Circuits that remain unknown will be identified as such and maximum details possible will be recorded on the test sheets</li>\n \t<li>In addition, we make all reasonable attempts to identify causes of circuit faults found, including disconnection of fixed equipment or luminaires as necessary</li>\n \t<li>It is not practical to inspect every joint and termination in an electrical installation. However, we will inspect every termination within distribution systems and distribution boards to ensure that the connections of the conductors are properly installed and secure</li>\n \t<li>A sample inspection will be made of all accessible parts of the electrical installation. The inspector will make allowance to inspect at least 10% of the termination points per power circuit and at least one luminaire and one switch per lighting circuit. At least one socket outlet in every room should be inspected, regardless of room size</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 3: Warning Signs</h3>\nWe ensure to provide adequate warning notices, displayed at each entry point, confirming the status of each site area and prohibiting when appropriate.\n<h3>Step 4: Electrical Safety</h3>\nThe inspector will not work on any electrical circuit in which all phase (live and neutral) conductors have not been isolated, except where this is necessary to carry out a particular test or procedure (for example: polarity, earth fault loop impedance and the functional testing of RCDs, RCBOs, switchgear and control gear). Before commencing work, isolation should be carried out by either physically removing the links or fuses and by a locking device securing the isolation in an “off” position.\n<h3>Step 5: Switching off Supplies</h3>\nThe Periodic Inspection and Testing procedure will require isolation of all electrical circuits for various periods of time. It is our responsibility to liaise directly with the building occupants prior to switching off any electrical supplies to agree upon suitable When agreeing the programme of circuit isolation with the occupants, we will make it clear to the occupants that they require total isolation of the electricity supplies to enable the testing to be carried out correctly and in safety as required by the Electricity at Work Regulations (1989). In the event of a project over-running, our inspectors will be prepared to temporarily cease operations until further agreement has been reached with the occupants.\n\n<strong>The following list of services can be affected by the isolation of local electrical circuits:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Intruder alarms</li>\n \t<li>Mechanical services control systems</li>\n \t<li>Loop alarms for equipment protection</li>\n \t<li>Fume extract systems</li>\n \t<li>CCTV security cameras and recorders</li>\n \t<li>Lift installations and associated control equipment</li>\n \t<li>Security screens</li>\n \t<li>Data network communications racks</li>\n \t<li>Emergency escape doors</li>\n \t<li>Fire alarm systems</li>\n \t<li>Door access systems</li>\n \t<li>Emergency escape lighting</li>\n \t<li>Mechanical services plant</li>\n \t<li>User’s equipment</li>\n</ul>\nWe also consider the effects on adjacent buildings and systems of such isolations and advise accordingly i.e. Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, Communication Systems, Data Hubs, Computer Systems and Security Systems. We always try to minimise the disruption to supplies, particularly to essential equipment.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Any requirement to save IT software is identified and actioned prior to the commencement of any electrical operations.</li>\n \t<li>Any contingency arrangements arising from the absence of electrical supplies are facilitated.</li>\n \t<li>Appropriate access and relocation/removal of any obstacles will be undertaken.</li>\n \t<li>All freezers/ fridges contain a minimum amount of perishable food stuffs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 6: Temporary Supplies</h3>\nWhere required, we shall make allowance to provide temporary supplies to the specific locations previously agreed with the users, for use when these area(s) need to be isolated for testing.\n<h3>Step 7: Re- Energisation</h3>\nIt is our responsibility to ensure that all circuits are operational on re-energisation. Time clocks for heating will be reset to the correct time and reprogrammed as necessary. Fire Detection and Security systems shall be checked\n<h3>Step 8: Repairs</h3>\nNo repairs or rectification works shall be commenced without first obtaining the correct authority from an appointed member of Origin Housing staff.\n<h3>Step 9: Dangerous Installations</h3>\nWhere the inspector determines that the condition or particular circumstances relating to an electrical installation represents immediate danger to our employees or any other person property or livestock, inspector shall take immediate action sufficient to remove the danger. This may include temporarily isolating the equipment, installing warning labels etc.\n<h2>How Often Should Fixed Electrical Testing be Conducted?</h2>\n<strong>The frequency of fixed electrical testing must be determined taking into account:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The type of installation</li>\n \t<li>Its use and operation</li>\n \t<li>The frequency and quality of maintenance</li>\n \t<li>The external influences to which it is subjected</li>\n</ul>\nAll buildings shall be subject to a full fixed electrical Test at the prescribed frequency. Partial testing of circuits or installations is not generally permitted. However, should detailed records, test results and drawings be available, the Duty Holder may relax the requirements subject to Risk Assessment. This is especially relevant to properties which may be the subject of short term lets. The frequency should be increased if the history indicates signs of progressive deterioration.\n\nFixed electrical testing identifies deficiencies in an electrical installation before they become serious hazards. Over time, all electrical installations deteriorate due to age, loading, wear and tear, mechanical damage, overheating, environment, poor maintenance, etc. Legislation requires that electrical installations are maintained in a safe condition and therefore must be periodically inspected and tested.",

      "content": "Electric Motor Testing is usually the first thing to be sacrificed when cutting back on operational expenses. But smart companies understands is that what this means for maintenance programs is millions of dollars of lost revenue through increased motor repair costs, downtime, and waste in industrial and commercial companies.\n<h2>Why is Electric Motor Testing Done?</h2>\nElectrical faults are the most usual means of motor failure, thus a planned electrical testing routine is crucial for safeguarding your plant reliability. Based on statistical data compiled by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), 50% of motor failures are due to electrical failures. The 50% can be further broken down into rotor problems (12%) and winding problems (38%). The other 50% of failures will be mechanical faults.Winding defects can occur due to insulation age, contamination, power surges, thermal overload, damaged wire/materials, vibration, and other causes. They start as energy crossing an insulation fault, like contamination or moisture, which cuts off at least one rotation. This leads to extra stress and heat across the fault, which increases until an arc is pulled and the winding flops.\n\n<strong>Some of the winding faults are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Between turns in a coil</li>\n \t<li>Between coils in a phase</li>\n \t<li>Between coils in different phases</li>\n \t<li>Between a coil or phase and ground</li>\n</ul>\nRemoving any of the above faults can save your organisation uncountable hours of interruption and numerous dollars in savings.\n<h2>What is Done During Electric Motor Testing?</h2>\n<strong>There are various kinds of testing done on motor. They are:</strong>\n<h3>Electric Motor Impulse Testing</h3>\nElectric Motor impulse testing is an integral part of predictive maintenance of electrical motors. Through the following questions the influence that extensive impulse testing has on a motor is investigated.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Can impulse testing harm deteriorated or healthy insulation?</li>\n \t<li>Can DC Resistance, Inductance, Megger or HiPot tests diagnose weak turn-to-turn insulation?</li>\n \t<li>After failing an impulse test, are motor with weak insulation able to operate?</li>\n \t<li>Are motors with a turn-turn short capable of continued operation? This was accomplished by putting a low voltage motor through extensive testing rigors, until inducing a failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Electric Motor Rotation Testing</h3>\nCheck for fan or pump motor rotation when testing offline with the MCE. Fans may continue to slowly rotate due to drafting in the Plenum. Pumps that are connected to a common header may continue to rotate if other pumps connected to the header are operating. This will adversely affect the Standard Test results, possibly creating higher than normal resistive and inductive imbalances.\n<h3>Wound Rotor Electric Motor Testing</h3>\nWound rotor motors have a three-phase winding wound on the rotor which is connected to three phases of start-up resistors in order to provide current and speed control on start-up. Failed components in the resistor bank are common and often overlooked when troubleshooting. These faults can have a significant impact on the overall operation of the motor and should be given considerable focus when troubleshooting these motors.\n<h3>Electric Motor Insulation Resistance Testing</h3>\nElectric motor insulation exhibits a negative temperature coefficient, meaning as temperature increases, resistance decreases. This would lead you to believe that insulation resistance of a de-energized motor will decrease after starting the motor. However, most often the resistance will initially increase after running due to moisture being evaporated by the increasing temperature of the windings. The governing standard (IEEE43) on insulation resistance testing requires a temperature correction to 40 degrees Celsius, which could quickly turn acceptable measured resistance readings into unacceptably low corrected resistance readings. Before sending a motor to be refurbished, consider space heaters.\n\n<strong>The recommended off-line in-service electric motor tests are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stator winding resistive imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Stator winding insulation resistance (Meg-Ohm checks)</li>\n \t<li>Polarization Index (PI)</li>\n \t<li>Step Voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Surge test</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The recommended spare electric motor tests are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stator winding resistive imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Stator winding insulation resistance (Meg-Ohm checks)</li>\n \t<li>Polarization Index (PI)</li>\n \t<li>Step Voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Surge test</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The recommended new/refurbished electric motor tests are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stator winding resistive imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Stator winding insulation resistance (Meg-Ohm checks)</li>\n \t<li>Polarization Index (PI)</li>\n \t<li>Step Voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Surge test</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Motor Testing Done?</h2>\n<strong>Following are the steps for different types of motor testing:</strong>\n<h3>All types</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check the appearance of the motor. Check for body damage or damage to the cooling fan blade or shaft.</li>\n \t<li>Manually rotate the shaft to check the bearing condition. Check for free &amp; smooth rotation.</li>\n \t<li>Note the motor data from the motor NAME PLATE.</li>\n \t<li>Earth Continuity: Use your ohmmeter to verify the resistance between earth and motor frame is less than 0.5 Ω.</li>\n \t<li>Power supply – correct voltage (230 volts per line), 415 v between Ll to L2, L2 to L3, and, L3 to L1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Three Phase</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Ensure the terminal for power supply is in good condition. Check the connection bar for terminal (U, V and W). Connection type - STAR OR DELTA.</li>\n \t<li>Confirm the power supply VOLTAGE for electric motor. 230/400.</li>\n \t<li>Using the multimeter, check the continuity of winding from phase to phase (U to V, V to W , W to U ).Each phase to phase must have a continuity if winding is OK.</li>\n \t<li>Check the motor winding ohms reading using multimeter or ohmmeter for phase to phase terminal( U to V,V to W ,W to U ).The ohms reading for each winding must be the same (or nearly the same).</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance of motor winding using Insulation tester meter set to the 500 Volt scale (1000v DC).</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">1. Check from phase to phase (U to V, V to W, W to U)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">2. Check from phase to earthing (U to E, V to E and W to E ). Minimum test value of the electric motor is 1 Meg Ohm (1 MΩ).</p>\n With the motor running, check the running amps of the motor using Clamp on meter.\n\n Compare to the FLA on the name plate of motor.\n\n If every step is completed, decide the condition of electrical motor either OK or NEED TO REPAIR.\n<h3>Single Phase</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check the motor winding ohms reading using multimeter or ohmmeter. (C to S, C to R, S to R). The reading for start to run should be equal to C to S + C to R.</li>\n \t<li>Proper recognition of electrical terminal. Common (C), Start (S) and Run (R) are the three terminal connections on hermetically sealed compressor. To identify the correct terminal connection the following procedure applies:</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">• The highest resistance reading is between the start and run terminals</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">• The middle resistance reading is between the start and common terminals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">• The lowest resistance reading is between the run and common terminals.</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance of motor winding using Insulation tester meter set to the 500 Volt scale. Verify from windings to earth (C to E, S to E and R to E) Minimum test value of the electric motor is 1 Meg Ohm (1 MΩ).</li>\n \t<li>With the motor running, check the running amps of the motor using Clamp on meter.</li>\n \t<li>Compare to the FLA on the name plate of motor.</li>\n \t<li>If every step is completed - decide the condition of the electrical motor: OK or NEED TO REPAIR.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dynamic Motor Testing</h2>\nThis is a current add-on to electrical testing technologies, this includes computing voltage and current of three phases of motor, while the motor is operating in its usual environment, and computing necessary data regarding the motor, power supply and load. Both electrical and mechanical issues can be identified.Power quality values, comprising unbalance, distortion and voltage level are calculated and matched with to industry standards. Bad power quality results in temperature rise within motor and as heat is the enemy of insulation, power quality problems should be pinpointed and rectified where possible.",

      "content": "Ground fault protection is the first line of defence. Once installed, ground fault protection systems stand by until needed to protect services and feeders. However, if these systems malfunction when a ground fault occurs, the distribution system and facility will be as damaged as if no systems were installed. Ground fault systems should be connected correctly and verified frequently. What is a ground fault? A ground fault is any short circuit that results in an unintended connection between an energized ungrounded phase conductor and ground. Ground faults are the most common type of fault on power distribution systems.\n<h2>Why is Ground Fault Testing Required?</h2>\nThe National Electrical Code (NEC), Art. 230.95(C) states, “The ground-fault protection system shall be performance tested when first installed on-site. The test shall be conducted in accordance with instructions that shall be provided with the equipment. A scripted record of this test should be created and should be accessible to the authority having control.”\n\nNational Electric Code for Fault protection states that ground fault relays are meant to protect equipment from low magnitude effects that pertain to the conduction of electricity between equipment and the conducting body. There is zero assurance for gear protection against influences of larger magnitude ground faults. Protections against higher magnitude ground faults are reliant upon protective devices such as fuses and circuit breakers.\n<h2>What is Done During Ground Fault Testing?</h2>\n<h3>Ground fault testing procedure of current transformer includes following tests:</h3>\n<strong>Testing neutral insulation resistance:\n</strong>Testing the insulation resistance is crucial, as issues are generated by the grounded neutrals downside of the sensing device. The first step is to temporarily remove the neutral disconnect link. Next, measure the resistance between the neutral and ground. The value should be a minimum of 1 megohm. If the neutral is discovered to be smaller than 1 megohm, rectify the issue before putting the equipment into service. It is common practice to use an ohmmeter to take this reading. Use caution if an insulation resistance test set is used. Putting high voltage on the neutral could damage the gear tied at circuit’s downside. Replace the neutral disconnect link after testing.\n\n<strong>Primary injection testing:\n</strong>This contains inserting primary current into gear’s neutral and phase conductors to match the movement of ground-fault current under different conditions. This will establish that transformers are wired and mounted properly and that the switch or breaker wont nuisance trip under normal operating conditions. The residual sensing method and zero-sequence sensing method are the two of the most common types of ground-fault systems.\n\n<strong>Testing reduced control voltage tripping capabilities:\n</strong>Most of the ground fault schemes need control voltage to function, and most schemes have control power transformers that source the control voltage. This is beneficial as ground-fault system is an individual system that do not need an additional source to function. The shortcoming is that the control power can be decreases in the course of a ground fault; yet, the gear must be capable of operating in reduced voltage to clear the fault.\n<h2>How is Ground Fault Testing Done?</h2>\n<h3>Ground Fault testing procedure of circuit transformer is:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The system performance testing as required by NEC 230.95(C) is most often required by the AHJ to be completed by a third-party electrical testing company and not by the installing contractor or owner. All testing should be done prior to energizing the device. Testing the ground-fault system requires that both the line and the load on the device being tested be de-energized. The only test that can be done on energized devices is with a secondary injection test set. Use of a secondary injection test set will test the electronics of the relay or trip unit, but does not insure the CT installation and wiring are correct. Use of the test-trip button will test the circuit within the relay or trip unit, but again does not insure the CT installation and wiring are correct. This does not meet the intent of performance testing as outlined in NEC 230.95(C). Use of the secondary test set or push-to-test button is like performance testing the safety features of a car while it is up on blocks — it may look good, but is not very effective.</li>\n \t<li>Primary current injection by a qualified third-party testing agency using the procedure as outlined by the manufacturer is the only effective way to test the ground-fault protection systems. Testing with a primary injection test set tests the integrity of all the system components including the relay or trip unit, control power, wiring and the external CT. With primary injection testing, typically both trip and non-trip tests are used to prove the polarity of the CTs or sensors and the wiring of the system. When a system requiring control power is tested, a reduced voltage test is also done to insure the system will trip even if the supply power has lost a phase. Many ground-fault systems require particular attention to the wire that is to be used. Some require minimum sizes of conductors, shield conductors or twisting together of the conductors when connecting to the CT. Verification that the polarity of the CT is correct is most often very difficult because of the location of the CT.</li>\n \t<li>Since the control power for the ground-fault system is most often a tap conductor on the line side of the overcurrent device, this may commonly be some type of disconnect device with a fuse block. This device is the control power for the ground-fault relay and should be confirmed to be in the “on” or “energized” position. Our field personnel have opened control cabinets to several systems in operation and found them in the “off” position. At that point, there is no way to know if it was never turned on, or if it was turned off at some point to cover up nuisance tripping or some other issue in the electrical system. If the control power is not provided to an external system, there will be no ground-fault protection. If the ground-fault system is purposely disabled and someone is injured, there could certainly be grounds for litigation.</li>\n \t<li>Because the third-party ground-fault protection performance testing is often done prior to the connection of the conductors, careful examination of the CT should be made once the conductors are pulled through the CT. Is there damage to the wiring or to the CT during installation of the conductors? Do all the conductors pass through the CT, and do they pass in the correct direction and all in the same direction? The grounding electrode conductor or equipment grounding conductor should not pass through the CT. This often causes nuisance tripping, and may prevent the device from accurately tripping at the device setting. If there are questions, the system should be reviewed, repaired and retested.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that the grounding system is complete. The grounding system is the return path for a system fault. Is the grounding electrode conductor landed in the correct position and in the correct structure? Are the other systems properly grounded and bonded to provide a complete grounding system?</li>\n \t<li>Review the connection of neutral conductors at each point in the system to insure they are not grounded downstream of the neutral bonding jumper. This is often verified when the ground fault performance test is done but is mostly performed when the electrical distribution system is still unfinished, so vigilant concentration should be observed to ensure the system will work correctly. Grounding of the neutral conductor most often makes the ground-fault protection system ineffective during a system ground fault condition.</li>\n</ul>\nWith the greatest percentage of electrical faults being phase-to-ground, the properly operable ground-fault protection system cannot only minimize damage to electrical equipment, but can also help to minimize the danger to personnel. Vigilant inspection of the ground-fault system is vital and needs a lot more concentration than just examining for a sticker.",

      "content": "Structured cabling is a costly affair and should be handled with care. The expense of replacement once the routes are all covered is higher. The error is not always clear as bending, crushing or kinking. Confirm with your cabling installer to make sure they have made facility to guard installed cabling from actions of other workers. This is considerably inexpensive than having to change cabling in the time ahead. If cable routes are shielded with no way of opening them between installation and termination, it is sensible to terminate the cables temporarily, so they can be tested before the routes are shielded.\n<h2>Why is Cable Testing Important?</h2>\nYou should never take an upgraded or fresh network for granted. In the case of a fresh or developed network, you believe and await its functioning to be perfect with no delays, no lost productivity or no bottlenecks. However there are some aspects that can cause poor functioning of the networks like:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Bad products, for example connectors, cables, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Improper system installation</li>\n</ul>\nWrong installation is the criminal, most of the time, after a fresh network has been completed. Thus after a fresh installation or huge upgrade, it is vital do cable testing as a final step to ensure everything is installed correctly and that not anything will stop or slow down your network.\n\nIn certified cable testing network cable performance is matched with industry standards and the result reveals a fail or pass. This type of testing makes sure that the freshly installed network will deliver the transmission speeds you hope for.\n\n<strong>A certified cable test can pick up on potential issues such as:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cable runs that are too long</li>\n \t<li>Too much cable tension</li>\n \t<li>Cable kinks or damage</li>\n \t<li>Malfunctioning cable</li>\n \t<li>Proper connector installation</li>\n \t<li>Improper termination</li>\n \t<li>Crossed wires</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During Cable Testing?</h2>\nCarelabs cable testing process is carried out with the help of a variety of refined equipment. We use cable testing gear and equipment that are appropriate to all kinds of cables ranging from 400V to 400 kV and all types of cable faults such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Earth faults</li>\n \t<li>Phase to Phase</li>\n \t<li>Cable Damage</li>\n \t<li>Resistive faults</li>\n \t<li>Intermittent faults</li>\n \t<li>Sheath faults</li>\n \t<li>Partial discharges</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Compare cable data with drawings and specifications. Give consideration to the cable size, number of sets, insulation rating and routing. Note these items on the test sheet.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect exposed sections of cable for physical damage. Look at the condition of the cable jacket and insulation of exposed sections. Verify that the connection points match what is shown on the project single-line diagram.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect bolted electrical connections for high resistance using with the use of a low-resistance ohmmeter, calibrated torque-wrench or thermographic survey.</li>\n \t<li>Check the state of the uncovered cable jacket and insulation when doing a visual inspection on low voltage wire and cable.</li>\n \t<li>Look at the condition of the exposed cable jacket and insulation when performing a visual inspection on low voltage wire and cable.</li>\n \t<li>Verify compression applied connections by checking that the connector is correctly rated for the installed cable dimension and has the right dents</li>\n \t<li>Perform an insulation-resistance test on each conductor with respect to ground and adjacent conductors. Test duration should be for one minute utilizing a voltage in accordance with manufacturers published data.</li>\n \t<li>Verify uniform resistance of parallel conductors using a low-resistance ohmmeter. Measure the resistance of each cable individually and investigate deviations in resistance between parallel conductors.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How is Cable Testing Done?</h2>\n<h3>Insulation Resistance:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>For 1 minute at 1000 Volts cables are tested with the help of megger.</li>\n \t<li>The lowest insulation resistance to earth or between phases shall be 100 megohms.</li>\n \t<li>The gear utilised for this calculation should have a low resolution of 10 megohms on the 0 to 500 megohm limit.</li>\n \t<li>In the end of Low Voltage insulation resistance testing, the neutrals should be connected to the earth rods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Phasing Test:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The correct phasing of all LV circuits shall be checked at all positions where the LV cables are terminated into fuse bases and where any LV cable is run from point to point.</li>\n \t<li>240V, i.e. the main frequency voltage is unacceptable here.</li>\n \t<li>The neutral conductor shall be connected to the earth stake for this test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Continuity Test (resistance of bolted connections):</h3>\nFor loop LV systems, to ensure that all bolted connections are whole and enough, a continuity test should be carried out on each LV circuit. The test is carried out as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>At the transformer, firmly bond all 4 conductors together</li>\n \t<li>If there is a service provision or open point, perform a continuity test, at the furthest extent of the network.</li>\n \t<li>Any difference in the readings of neutral and each phase conductor, greater than 10% may indicate a dirty or loose connection and will require further investigation.</li>\n \t<li>The instrument used for this measurement, usually megger, should have a resolution to the second decimal point in the 0 to 5 ohm range.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Earth Resistance Test:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>At any point along the length of a LV feeder in any overhead or underground network, the earth resistance can have a maximum value of 10 ohms prior to connection to the existing network.</li>\n \t<li>The overall resistance to earth should be less than 1 ohm prior to connection to the existing network, in any overhead or underground network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>For 11 KV AND 33 KV XLPE Cables:</h2>\n<h3>Phasing Test</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>At all points where the HV cables have been ended, correct phasing of high voltage circuits should be checked.</li>\n \t<li>The test may be conducted on either the wire screens or the aluminium conductors. 240V, i.e. the main frequency voltage is unacceptable here.</li>\n \t<li>Wires should be disconnected from earth, where the test is performed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outer Sheath Insulation Resistance:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The purpose of the test is to determine soundness of the outer polyethylene sheath against water ingress, mechanical damage and termite attack.</li>\n \t<li>Measure less than 0.5 megohms can show sheath damage. Values between 1.0 and 10 megohms may not indicate damage in a single location. Fault finding can often be very difficult. In new cables, values of greater than 100 megohms are required.</li>\n \t<li>The reliability of the outer sheath should be verified after cables have been buried by megger at 1000 Volts.</li>\n \t<li>The test shall be conducted for 1 minute between each wire screen and earth after the cable has been jointed and terminations installed.</li>\n \t<li>After repairs, the resistance of the cable should not be less than 10 megohms.</li>\n \t<li>Where HV cable circuits are cut and joined to new circuits, sheath testing must be carried out on the existing old circuit prior to joining to the new cable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Certification:</h3>\nWhen all the tests have been pleasingly finished, sign and date the test form. The complete test form should be filed with the appropriate job pack.",

      "content": "Capacitor Banks consists of tuning reactors, capacitors and inrush limiting reactors. To lower the electricity bill and to decrease shortfalls in the distribution system, power factor correction units or capacitor banks are added to counterbalance as much of the magnetizing current as possible. Capacitors in most power factor correction unit draw current that leads the voltage, thus giving a leading power factor.\n\nCapacitor bank tests requires test instrument within calibration date, tagged and tested. Insulation resistance tester, Capacitance Bridge, multimeter, three phase balanced voltage source, high speed recorder and single phase current source.\n<h2>Why is Capacitance Bank Test Necessary?</h2>\nCapacitors banks performs a vital role in giving your power system proper power factor correction. Power Factor Correction unit have different operating environments dependent on the place they are installed. Moisture, harmonics, temperature and time affects the power factor correcting ability of capacitor banks. Already installed capacitor banks, if not tested or unmaintained within specific time period, becomes incapable of functioning at their finest levels. With time, the operation of capacitors can weaken, decreasing the power factor of your power system, resulting in power factor loss.\n\nCarelabs provides you with comprehensive capacitor maintenance services, making sure that your capacitor banks is functioning to the best of its capacities. Carelabs offers testing for a variety of capacitors, comprising fixed capacitor banks and automatic capacitor banks\n<h2>What is Done During Capacitor Bank Testing?</h2>\n<h3>There are 3 types of tests in the testing plan.

      "content": "Secondary injection tests are done to ensure proper functioning of the protection system. Secondary protection system consists of auxiliary relays, protective relays, protection circuits, metering devices, communications and control systems, low-voltage devices etc. Secondary injection test comprises not only the <a href=\"https://carelabs.me/what-protective-device-testing-how-done/\">testing of protective relays</a> and their tripping settings, but also the verifying of all related circuits and gears included in the correct functioning of the secondary protection system.\n<h2>Why is Secondary Current Injection Test Important?</h2>\nThe purpose of secondary injection testing is to check that the protection scheme from the relay input terminals onwards is functioning correctly with the settings specified.\n\nSecondary injection test is done prior to primary injection test, Due to the threats associated with the initial testing to the low voltage side of the device under test are reduced. The primary or high voltage side of the device is detached, so that no harm can occur.\n\nIt is a crucial test that should be carried out on a trip unit in the course of a service. By connecting secondary injection test sets we can ensure that the trip unit, associated components and its settings or factory parameters are functioning as they should. It is also an important test for a circuit breaker once a mechanical inspection and service is performed as the breaker is recurrently closed, opened and charged.\n<h2>What is Done During Secondary Injection Test?</h2>\nThe extent of testing will be largely determined by the client specification and relay technology used, and may range from a simple check of the relay characteristic at a single point to a complete verification of the tripping characteristics of the scheme, including the response to transient waveforms and harmonics and checking of relay bias characteristics. This may be important when the protection scheme includes transformers and/or generators. It is clear that a modern test set can facilitate these tests, leading to a reduced time required for testing.\n\n<strong>The secondary injection test involves disconnection of the device and/or circuits and consists of following tests:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Test all kind of relays: the relay testing through secondary injection test may range from a simple check of some points of the relay characteristic to a complete verification of the protection scheme logic, even including the response to transient waveforms, harmonics, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Test switches and connections</li>\n \t<li>Check on-load wiring, trips, alarms and communications circuits, currents and voltage wiring, phase by phase.</li>\n \t<li>Check phasing and polarity up to the relay terminals.</li>\n \t<li>Test current, voltage and energy meters, transducers, sensors, motor overload units, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Check low voltage circuit breakers (if solid-state trip units have accessible terminal blocks for secondary injection test, otherwise the primary current injection is preferred because verifies all the breaker, and not only the trip unit)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Secondary Injection Test Performed?</h2>\n<strong>Following are the various tests in secondary injection test:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Three phase non-directional pick up and drop off accuracy over complete current setting range for both stages</li>\n \t<li>Three phase directional pick up and drop off accuracy over complete RCA setting range in the forward direction, reverse direction in current angle sweep and forward direction, reverse direction in voltage angle sweep.</li>\n \t<li>Three phase polarising voltage threshold test</li>\n \t<li>Precision of DT timer across whole setting range</li>\n \t<li>Precision of IDMT curves with appealed precision range</li>\n \t<li>Accuracy of IDMT TMS/TD</li>\n \t<li>Minimum Pick-Up of Starts and Trips for IDMT curves</li>\n \t<li>Accuracy of reset timers</li>\n \t<li>Effect of any blocking signals, opto inputs, VTS, Auto reclose</li>\n \t<li>Voltage polarisation memory</li>\n</ul>\nAll the results should be carefully noted and filed for record purposes. Departures from the expected results must be thoroughly investigated and the cause determined. After rectification of errors, all tests whose results may have been affected, even those that may have given correct results, should be repeated to ensure that the protection scheme has been implemented according to specification.\n\nFor protection relays, testing at site itself is a usual procedure, but the other equipment in most occasions are sent to a laboratory for calibration, leading to significant costs and efforts.\n<h2><strong>Testing Modes of Secondary Injection Test</strong></h2>\n<h3>No-Trip Mode</h3>\nThe protective functions of the electronic trip device can be tested, but the trip device won't send a trip signal to the circuit breakers trip actuator. This test can be performed while the circuit breaker is energized and carrying load current because a no-trip test won't cause the circuit breaker to open.\n<h3>Trip Mode</h3>\nThe protective operations of the electronic circuit are checked similar to a no-trip mode test, with the exception that the trip unit will launch a signal to the circuit breakers trip actuator. This will lead to the opening of circuit breaker, this is the reason this test is normally done only when a circuit breaker is removed from its section and therefore detached from the switchgear bus.\n\nTrip test is most suitable for correct a distrusted circuit breaker operation. The self-test function does not validate the functioning of the circuit breakers current sensors and the associated current wiring.\n<h3>Self-test Mode</h3>\nFew new solid-state trip gears and protective relays consists of built in self-test operations that needs no discrete test kit. Trip unit self-tests are much simpler to do than any other test and can be performed more often.\n\nSelf-test operation doesn't validates the operation of the circuit breakers current wiring and current sensors.\n<h3>Circuit Breaker:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Prior to the installation of a new circuit breaker or returning it back to its service following a maintenance inspection, the breaker must be positioned at its section in the test position and electrically drove by opening and closing its contacts from as many control devices as possible. Verifying proper operation of circuit breaker electrical controls, validates the reliability of control components, control wiring and the source of control power.</li>\n \t<li>While a circuit breaker is in its test position, the terminating its main contacts may not attach the <a href=\"https://carelabs.me/electric-switchgear-testing-services/\">switchgear line bus</a> with associated load circuit. In such occasions, a circuit breaker must never be verified inside its switchgear section while workers are doing operations on electrical gear that is attached and is live, to the associated load circuit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Benefits of Secondary Injection Test</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Can test electronic breakers</li>\n \t<li>Quick</li>\n \t<li>Tests trip unit</li>\n \t<li>Easier</li>\n \t<li>Takes less expertise to run the test</li>\n \t<li>Test kit is small and portable</li>\n \t<li>Less expensive</li>\n</ul>",

      "content": "Leakage current is the current that streams from either DC or AC circuit in an electrical system to the frame, or to the earth or ground, and can be either from the output or input. The current will stream through other pathways such as the human body, if the equipment is not properly earthed. This might also occur if the ground is ineffective or is intruded unintentionally or intentionally.\n<h2>Why is Leakage Current Measurement Important?</h2>\nElectrical system usually consists of a grounding technique that offers shield against a shock hazard if an insulation fault occurs. The grounding system comprises of a grounding rod that connects the instrument to the earth. If ever a disastrous failure of insulation between power line and conductive parts occur, the voltage will be pushed to ground. The current that is created as a result of this event will flow, causing a circuit breaker to open or a fuse to blow thus avoiding a shock hazard.\n\nClearly, a shock hazard prevails if the earth or ground connection is intruded, either accidentally or intentionally. The possibility for a shock might be larger than assumed if there is case of leakage currents. Even in the scenario of no insulation failure, intrusion of leakage currents streaming through the grounding rod still pose a threat of electric shock to somebody coming in contact with the ungrounded system and ground at the same time.\n\nThis is a huge concern when it comes to the field of medical applications, where a patient might be the receiver of the electric shock. A shock can be even fatal if the patient is weak or unconscious, or if the current flows to internal organs. The two layered insulation offered in non-grounded equipment ensures protection. The security in this scenario is made sure because both coats of insulation are not likely to collapse together. Nevertheless, the situations that leads to leakage currents still exists and must be taken into account.\n\nHence, how can you eradicate or reduce the outcomes of leakage current? Measure the leakage current and then recognise the cause.\n<h2>What is Done During Leakage Current Measurements?</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A meter specially designed for measuring leakage currents is used.</li>\n \t<li>The current streaming through the ground rod is quantified by attaching the meter in series with the earthing connection.</li>\n \t<li>For information processing equipment, the ground connection is opened and the current flowing to the neutral side of the power line is measured.</li>\n \t<li>The meter may also be connected between the outputs of the power supply and ground.</li>\n \t<li>The test conditions include swapping the ac line and neutral connections, and turning power switches off and on while monitoring the current.</li>\n \t<li>The test is done once the system have warmed to typical functioning temperature.</li>\n \t<li>The intention is to identify and measure the worst-case leakage current.</li>\n \t<li>For very small leakage currents, the meter is substituted with a network comprising of either a resistor or a resistor and capacitor grouping.</li>\n \t<li>The voltage drop throughout the network is then quantified using an ac voltmeter.</li>\n \t<li>Double-insulated equipment or ungrounded is verified by attaching the meter amid any touchable conductive part and earth.</li>\n \t<li>In the case of nonconductive housings, a copper foil of a specific size is placed on the housing, and the current flowing from it to ground is measured.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<table width=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"300\">Type of Equipment<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n<td width=\"300\">Maximum Leakage Current<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"300\">Class I<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n<td width=\"300\">0.75mA for hand held devices<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"300\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n<td width=\"300\">3.5mA for other devices<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"300\">Class II<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n<td width=\"300\">0.25mA<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"300\">Class III<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n<td width=\"300\">No hazardous voltages<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>How is Leakage Current Measurement Performed?</h2>\nLeakage current clamp meter is used to measure leakage current. They are similar to the clamp meters utilised for finding load currents, but gives considerably better results when quantifying currents less than 5mA. Generally clamp meters wouldn't register such small currents. After we position the jaws of a clamp meter around a conducting rod or wire, the current reading is taken, and the value depends upon the intensity of the alternating electromagnetic field around the conductor. The clamp meter will identify the magnetic field around conductors like a wire armor cable, single core cable, a water pipe etc. The paired neutral and phase conductors of a single-phase circuit, or all live conductors of a three-phase circuit.\n<h3>Testing different kinds of conductors:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>When testing the grouped live conductors of a circuit, the magnetic fields produced by the load currents cancel each other out. Any uneven current coming from the conductors to ground is measured with a leakage clamp meter and must have a reading less than 0.1 mA.</li>\n \t<li>If you performed an insulation test on a circuit that was powered down, the result would be in the range of 50MΩ or further, because the insulation tester utilises s a dc voltage for checking, which do not consider the capacitive effect.</li>\n \t<li>If you measured the same circuit loaded with office equipment, the result would be significantly different due to the capacitance of the input filters on these devices.</li>\n \t<li>When a lot of parts of equipment are functioning on a circuit, the result will be collective, that is, the leakage current will be greater and could well be in the range of milliamps. Adding new pieces of equipment to a circuit protected by a GFCI could trip the GFCI. And as the value of leakage current differs based on how the equipment is functioning, the GFCI may trip unintentionally.</li>\n \t<li>When telecommunications equipment is present, the value of leakage indicated by a clamp meter may be considerably more than that resulting from insulation impedance at 60 Hz because, telecommunications system usually consists of filters that generate functional grounding currents and other gears that generates harmonics, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Measurement of Leakage Current to Ground Conductor</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>When the load is switched on, the leakage current measured includes leakage in load equipment. If the leakage is adequately small with the load attached, then circuit wiring leakage is even smaller.

      "content": "Fixed Wire Testing is a vital drill for any venture. As wires can weaken over time, your workplace could be considered no longer safe and compliant with current Electricity at Work Regulations. This puts you at risk of liability for an electrical incident, including any damage to the building, and injuries sustained by a member of the public or your staff.\n\nFive yearly fixed-wire testing is a legal procedure for organisations to ensure that all electrical equipment is safe for human use, but this process could leave electrical components as a danger in the time between tests, potentially causing accidents in the workplace. Instead of this, a new approach to fixed wire testing came as a result of recent amendments to the IEE's wiring regulations, which states that electrical installations should not be left for five years as was previously the case.  Instead the procedure should be to complete an annual visual check of electrical installations for damage that may have happened over the year. The aforementioned 20% physical check is also adopted by many organisations as well.\n<h2>Why Fixed Wire Testing?</h2>\nIt is a legal requirement. The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is an act of parliament which places a duty on all employers to; ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety and welfare at work of all their employees.\n\nWithin the act there is a provision for regulations which cover the legal requirement pertaining to specific subject areas and The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 covers electrical systems within occupied premises. The purpose of the regulations is to prevent death or personal injury to any person from electrical causes in connection with work activities.\n\nEmployers and self-employed people must comply with the provisions of the Electricity at work regulations 1989. Regulation 4 (2) states that as necessary to prevent danger, all systems shall be maintained so as to prevent, so far as reasonably practicable, such danger\n<h2>What is Fixed Wire Testing?</h2>\nFixed Wire Testing is the testing of the electrical installations within a building to ensure they are safe &amp; compliant, and employers are legally required to ensure, as far as is reasonably practical, the health, safety and welfare of their employees. Fixed wire testing is a crucial part of that requirement.\n\nTesting your buildings electrical installations also provides additional benefits to you, identifying areas where you can reduce electrical energy usage, helping with your green credentials as well as saving you costs.\n\nFixed Wire Testing relies on a mixture of visual inspections and specialist equipment to determine safety.\n<h2>How do we do Fixed Wire Testing?</h2>\nCircuits must be switched of to ensure safe Fixed Wire Testing and so that the condition of the circuit can be identified, which may cause some inconvenience to those using the facilities. It may be better to arrange for testing to happen outside operational hours. Specialist equipment is used for the tests to highlight any lack of earthing or bonding, discover and rectify overloaded circuits and to find potential hazards. Circuit breakers and trip mechanisms will be tested and put through tests to replicate fault conditions to ensure their fail-safe mechanisms are] sound. Common faults found in electrical installations are faulty equipment or wiring, overloaded sockets and circuits, broken accessories and poor installation work.\n<h2>Testing:</h2>\n<h3>We perform the following tests:</h3>\n<strong>Test 1: Switching devices inspection\n</strong>Visual inspection of a small sample of switching devices to assess their working condition\n\n<strong>Test 2: Protective devices inspection\n</strong>Verification of the accessibility, condition and presence of those devices used for isolation, protection and switching. Overload settings and protection of the fuse or circuit-breaker will be assessed\n\n<strong>Test 3: Marking and labelling\n</strong>Ensuring that each circuit is labelled correctly and that the following is clearly marked; different voltages, earthing and bonding connections, Residual Current Devices (or R.C.Ds)\n\n<strong>Test 4: Continuity of Protective Conductors and Earthed Equipotential Bonding\n</strong>Verifying the continuity of any installations that may be safely isolated from the supply. Continuity and earth fault loop impedance tests will ensure the combined integrity of conductors.\n\n<strong>Test 5: Polarity Test\n</strong>Ensuring correct polarity at the meter and consumer unit (or distribution board), socket outlets have safe connections with their conductors, lamp holders are correctly attached to the earthed neutral conductor and multi-pole devices have been installed correctly.\n\n<strong>Test 6: Earth Fault Loop Impedance\n</strong>Connection of a resistor from the phase to the protective conductor to confirm correct connection and warn of reversed polarity.\n\n<strong>Test 7: Insulation Resistance\n</strong>Ensuring insulation prevents the leakage of electrical current.\n\n<strong>Test 8: Operation of Devices for Isolation and Switching\n</strong>Verifying how effective isolation and switching devices are as well as their labels and markings.\n\n<strong>Test 9: Operation of Residual Current Devices\n</strong>Simulation of fault conditions to ensure that current trips where it should.\n<h2>Reporting:</h2>\nReporting is an essential part of the Fixed Wire Testing procedure and any signs of wear, damage, deterioration or overheating from the initial visual inspection, or any problems that breach regulations must be included in this document, known as the Electrical Installation Condition Report. The report will have the results of each test and show whether the tested areas and installations are safe to use until the next due installation.\n<h2>How Often Should you do Fixed Wire Testing?</h2>\nHow often you should conduct Fixed Wire Testing can depend on a lot of factors, including the type of installation and where it is (e.g. a hospital, educational establishment, office or shop, etc). It will also depend on the amount of use and the way an installation is used, how frequently (and how well) an installation is maintained and any external influences, such as the environment and conditions in which it is kept.\n\nA change of occupancy will usually trigger a need for Fixed Wire Testing and for the majority of commercial properties, a period of 5 years between Fixed Wire Testing Inspections is required, with routine checks being completed annually. This is as recommended by IET guidelines.\n\nRegular audits of your sites will help you manage and prioritise how often Fixed Wire Testing should be conducted and good record keeping is essential for ensuring you can easily locate necessary certificates of compliance and Electrical Installation Condition Reports. Choosing a contractor with nationwide coverage, like Carelabs, is a good idea if you have multiple sites and will help you negotiate rates and levels of service.\n\nNotify staff well in advance about upcoming testing so that they are aware to save their computer work or power down machinery.",
