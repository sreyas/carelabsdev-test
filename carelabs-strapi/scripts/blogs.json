    "content": "Harmonics are produced by non-linear loads that absorb non-sinusoidal current. These non-sinusoidal currents contain harmonic currents that interact with the impedance of the power distribution system to create voltage distortion that can affect both the distribution system equipment and the loads connected to it.\n\nIf the impedance changes with the applied voltage, then the load is considered non-linear. Due to this changing impedance, the current drawn by the non-linear load is also non-linear i.e. non-sinusoidal in nature, even when it is connected to a sinusoidal voltage source.\n\nThe most common loads, both in industrial surroundings and domestic ones, that can cause harmonics are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Frequency / Variable speed drives</li>\n \t<li>Discharge lamps (high pressure sodium vapour lamp, mercury vapour lamp, low consumption, fluorescent, etc.)</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers</li>\n \t<li>AC/DC Converters</li>\n \t<li>Arc welding</li>\n \t<li>Induction ovens</li>\n \t<li>UPS</li>\n \t<li>Computers and laptops</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to avoid or right harmonic problems that could happen within an industrial facility, an assessment of system harmonics must be done if:\n<ul>\n \t<li>A plant is enlarged and considerable non-linear loads are put in.</li>\n \t<li>A power factor rectification capacitor banks or line harmonic filters are inserted at the service entrance or in the neighborhood.</li>\n \t<li>A generator is inserted in the plant as a substitute stand-by power source.</li>\n \t<li>The utility company imposes more restrictive harmonic injection limits to the plant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why Voltage Harmonic Study and Analysis Important?</strong></h2>\nThe existence of harmonics doesn’t mean that the factory cannot run appropriately. Like other power quality phenomena, it depends on the stiffness of the power distribution system and the susceptibility of the equipment. There are numerous types of equipment that can have failures or mis-operations because of high harmonic voltage and/or current levels. This harmonic pollution is frequently send back onto the electric utility distribution system and might affect amenities on the same system which are more vulnerable.\n\n<strong>Few effects of voltage harmonics are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Incorrect reading meters,</li>\n \t<li>Reduced true PF, where PF= Watts/VA.</li>\n \t<li>Overheated transformers will circulate in the primary side.</li>\n \t<li>Zero, negative sequence voltages on motors and generators.</li>\n \t<li>Nuisance operation of protective devices, including false tripping of relays and failure of a UPS to transfer properly, especially if controls incorporate zero-crossing sensing circuits.</li>\n \t<li>Blown fuses on PF correction caps because of high currents and voltage from resonance with line impedance.</li>\n \t<li>Mis-operation or failure of electronic equipment</li>\n \t<li>The effect on lighting is called flicker, if there are voltage subharmonics in the range of 1-30Hz.</li>\n \t<li>Distortion of unwanted currents, main supply voltage flowing in the supply network generate additional energy losses.</li>\n \t<li>Disturbed operation of florescent lamps, defective operation of regulating devices, television receivers or other equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Malfunction of ripple control and other mains signaling systems, protective relays and, possibly, other of control systems.</li>\n \t<li>Telephone interference.</li>\n \t<li>High harmonic amplitudes may not only cause malfunctions, additional losses and overheating, but also overload the power distribution network and overheat the neutral conductor and cause it to burn out.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\"><strong>Electrical component</strong></td>\n<td width=\"312\"><strong>Effects</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Conductor</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Current increase\n\n·         Resistance increase\n\n·         Increase in thermal loss (Joule’s effect)\n\n·         Skin Effect\n\n·         Cable heating\n\n·         Tripping of protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Neutral Conductor</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Circulation of multiple of 3 harmonics\n\n·         Return through neutral conductor\n\n·         Overcurrent flowing in neutral\n\n·         Heating on neutral\n\n·         Premature degrading neutral conductor\n\n·         Neutral –earth voltage\n\n·         Tripping of protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Capacitors</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Parallel resonance with the system\n\n·         Harmonic gain\n\n·         Heating\n\n·         Premature aging of capacitors\n\n·         Capacitor destruction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Transformers</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Current harmonics flowing through windings\n\n·         Overheating of the windings\n\n·         Thermal insulation loss due to heating\n\n·         Copper and Metal loss\n\n·         Reduction in performance\n\n·         Extra-large transformer\n\n·         Transformer saturation (creates greater distortion)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Motors</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Current harmonics flowing through\n\n·         windings\n\n·         Overheating of the windings.\n\n·         Thermal insulation loss due to heating.\n\n·         Copper and Metal loss (Hysteris and Foucault)\n\n·         Decrease in performance\n\n·         Vibrations on the axis, mechanical wear on\n\n·         bearings and eccentric bearings\n\n·         Torque reduction\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Power generating set\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Soft system, with greater impedance than the grid\n\n·         Distorted voltage\n\n·         Difficultly in automatic synchronisation and later switching\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Control and\n\nmeasuring equipment</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Invalid measurements\n\n·         Errors in control processes\n\n·         Error in equipment taking the zero reference of wave\n\n·         Saturation of measurement and/or protection measurement.\n\n·         Incorrect magnitude values\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>What is Done During Voltage Harmonics Study and Analysis?</h2>\nThe quantity of voltage harmonics will mostly be influenced by the source impedance, which includes all of the wiring and transformers back to the source of the electricity and the amount of harmonic currents being pulled by the load. Ohm’s Law is true for harmonic values as well. A “stiff” system, that is if the source harmonic impedance is very low, then the harmonic currents will result in lower harmonic voltages than if the source impedance were high.\n\n<strong>Comprehensive Harmonic Analysis Includes:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Predictive analysis for harmonic distortion</li>\n \t<li>Thorough report with recommendations</li>\n \t<li>Determine compliance with power quality standards - IEEE-519, IEEE 1547,  BS G5/4,  AS2279,  EN 61000-4-7</li>\n \t<li>Power factor analysis if needed</li>\n \t<li>Technical recommendations to solve or prevent power quality problems</li>\n \t<li>Analysis and reports follow IEEE-399 Guidelines</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Fourier Series:</strong> The analysis of harmonics is the means of computing the phases and magnitudes of the high order and fundamental harmonics of the periodic waveforms. The resulting series is known as Fourier series. It establishes a relation between a function in the domain of time and a function in the domain of frequency.\n\nThe Fourier’s theorem states that every non-sinusoidal periodic wave can be decomposed as the sum of sine waves through the application of the Fourier series, given the following conditions:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The integral over one period of the function is a finite value.</li>\n \t<li>The function possesses a finite number of discontinuities in a period.</li>\n \t<li>The function possesses a finite number of maxima and minima in a period.</li>\n</ul>\nThe Fourier series of a periodic function x(t) is expressed as:\n\nThis constitutes a representation of periodic function in the domain of the frequency.\n\nIn this expression, a0 is the average value of the function x(t), where an and bn are the coefficients of the series besides being the rectangular components of the n harmonic. For the corresponding n harmonic its vector is:\n\nWith a magnitude and an angle of phase:\n\n<strong>Hand-held Harmonic</strong> meters are used for performing spot checks for known harmonic problems. However, harmonic values will often change during the day, as different loads are turned on and off within the facility or in other facilities on the same electric utility distribution system. This requires the use of a harmonic monitor or power quality monitor with harmonic capabilities, which can record the harmonic values over a period of time.\n\n<strong>Harmonic Analysis Software</strong> can be used to simulate harmonic voltage sources and current, decrease nuisance trips, recognize harmonic problems, design and test filters, and report harmonic current and voltage distortion limit violations.\n\nComprehensive load flow and frequency scan calculations are performed using detailed harmonic source models and power system component frequency models. Outcomes are represented graphically involving harmonic spectrum plots, harmonic order and harmonic waveform plots.\n\n<strong>Complied Harmonic Standards:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>IEEE 519</li>\n \t<li>ANSI/IEEE 399</li>\n \t<li>IEEE 141</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The main sources of harmonics are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Arc furnaces and other elements of arc discharge, such as fluorescent lamps. Arc furnaces are considered as voltage harmonic generators more than current generators. Typically, all harmonics appear but the odd harmonics are predominant with typical values with regard to the fundamental harmonic:</li>\n \t<li>The third harmonic represents 20%, and the fifth harmonic represents 10%.</li>\n \t<li>The seventh harmonic represents 6%, and the ninth harmonic represents 3%.</li>\n \t<li>Magnetic cores in rotating machines and transformers need 3rd harmonic current to stimulate the iron.</li>\n \t<li>The inrush current of transformers produces second and fourth harmonics.</li>\n \t<li>Adjustable speed controllers used in fans, pumps, and process controllers.</li>\n \t<li>Solid‐state switches which modulate control currents, light intensity, heat, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Controlled sources for electronic equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers based on diodes and thyristors for welding equipment, battery chargers, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Static reactive power compensators.</li>\n \t<li>DC high voltage transmission stations.</li>\n \t<li>AC to DC converters (inverters).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Voltage Harmonics Study and Analysis Performed?</h2>\n<strong>Following are the steps in voltage harmonic analysis of power transformer:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Draw the single line diagram of electrical installation</li>\n \t<li>Determine the characteristic of power transformer</li>\n \t<li>Indicate the load distribution</li>\n \t<li>Distortioners</li>\n \t<li>Non-distortioners</li>\n \t<li>Identify the measuring points and define each measuring points</li>\n \t<li>Determine whether the level of work demanded during measurements is known</li>\n \t<li>If yes, carry out measurements.</li>\n \t<li>If no, consult the owner</li>\n \t<li>Carry out the measurement for</li>\n \t<li>Supply/PCC: Check battery and note power. Perform the measurement with and without battery connected.</li>\n \t<li>Critical secondary switch boards: Determine the number of loads. Measure the neutral current and current imbalance.</li>\n \t<li>Distortioning loads: perform measurement on load. Perform measurement of different work regimes</li>\n \t<li>Interpret the data measured, aiming to recognize the effects harmonics produce on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Methods for Harmonic Mitigation:</strong>\n\nAfter the diagnosis and the assessment of the disturbances we move onto the treatment or solution. We must always look for a balance between the technical solution and the economic one. The ideal technical solution will be to filter directly the disturbing loads avoiding the propagation of the harmonic currents against other loads and installation, and a greater drop in harmonic voltage which would provoke the distortion of the voltage wave. In other cases, the solution is to look for a solution as near as possible to the loads.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><u>Delta-Delta and Delta-Wye Transformers</u></strong>: This configuration uses two separate utility feed transformers with equal non-linear loads. This shifts the phase relationship to various six-pulse converters through cancellation techniques</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>Isolation Transformers</u></strong>: An isolation transformer provides a good solution in many cases to mitigate harmonics generated by nonlinear loads. The advantage is the potential to “voltage match” by stepping up or stepping down the system voltage, and by providing a neutral ground reference for nuisance ground faults.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>Use of Reactors:</u></strong> It is a cheap and simple method to decrease the harmonics generated by non-linear loads and is an improved solution for harmonic decrease than an isolation transformer.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>Passive Harmonic Filters (or Line Harmonic Filters)</u></strong>: Passive or Line harmonic filters (LHF) are also named as harmonic trap filters and are utilised to remove or control more leading, lower order harmonics particularly fifth, seventh, eleventh and thirteenth. LHF is comprised of a passive L-C circuit which is tuned to a specific harmonic frequency which needs to be mitigated.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>12-pulse converter front end</u></strong>: In this the front end of the bridge rectifier circuit utilizes 12 diodes instead of 6. The advantages are the decrease of the fifth and seventh harmonics to a bigger order where the eleventh and thirteenth become the prevalent harmonics. This will reduce the amount of these harmonics but will not remove them.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>18-pulse converter front end:</u></strong> An 18-pulse converter front end topology is involved of either a 3 phase to 9 phase isolation transformers or a lower cost patented design of 3 phase to 9 phase autotransformers, to produce a phase shift of ±20° necessary for the 18-pulse operation, and a 9-phase diode rectifier containing 18 diodes to convert 9 phase AC to DC.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is essential to follow the procedure for the study of the analysis of harmonic disturbance, if we omit any of the steps, the measurement and study process will be very complicating and, in many cases, we will be unable to give a possible solution to our solution.\n\n<strong>In short, the following should be carried out: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Define the objective of the study</li>\n \t<li>An electrical drawing of the installation and how the loads are distributed.</li>\n \t<li>To define measurement points and to identify them in the drawing</li>\n \t<li>Load level during measuring</li>\n \t<li>Interpret the data calculated trying to identify the effects of the harmonics and based on what the directive, standard or regulation establishes.</li>\n</ul>",
